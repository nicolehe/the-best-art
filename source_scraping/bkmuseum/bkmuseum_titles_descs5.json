The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u2019s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior \r\nItalian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro \r\nMendini. Memphis pieces, such as the \"Casablanca\" cabinet \r\ndisplayed here, were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the \r\npostmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted \r\nonly for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries \r\nof modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.",

Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story\u2014sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.",

The most famous example is the sixteenth-century garden of the Zen temple Ryonanji in Kyoto, which in expressing the expanse of the oceans is intended to represent the entire universe. In order to achieve the same effect in his ceramic vessel, Sakiyama constructed the form from three slabs of clay that were carved into the wave pattern. After firing the vase once, he then covered it with a sand-infused glaze and refired it to stoneware temperature.",

The Thunderbolt was closed in 1983 and demolished in 2000 together with the house, which was occupied until the end. The site remains empty today, next to the new KeySpan Park. The Tornado, the second of the signature roller coasters, also on the Bowery, burned in 1977, while the third, the Cyclone, has been a New York City Historic Landmark since 1991. KeySpan Park, home of the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team, opened on the site of Steeplechase Park in 2001 and was part of longtime efforts to rejuvenate Coney Island.",

In this instance, the designer has worked largely on a computer to realize his design. He began with a birch plywood cube, a modern building material, and two traditional images, of a Baroque table and a bomb\u00e9 chest (a low cabinet with serpentine curves), which he conflated and morphed on his computer. He then divided his design into fifty-seven virtual slices, or cross-sections, and utilizing a computer numerical controlled (CNC) laser, cut the cube from two directions simultaneously to create a silhouette with complex compound curves. The table is composed of 741 layers of birch plywood. It was limited to an edition of twenty that is now sold out.",

The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchit\u00e1n of the Women (1979\u201386). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchit\u00e1n, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.\n\r\nLike her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist\u2019s own word, \u201ccomplicity.\u201d",

Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.\n\r\nLike her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist\u2019s own word, \u201ccomplicity.\u201d",

The few Israeli artists who do create modernist jewelry have often studied abroad and exhibit and sell their designs in Europe. Schocken, who lives in Jerusalem, was trained as an architect in Israel and then went to England to learn jewelry making. Her jewelry is reductivist and abstract and reflects her lifelong passion for modern architecture, in particular Tel Aviv's well-known cache of Bauhaus-inspired buildings from the 1920s and 1930s.",

It is based on the tragic events surrounding a nationally televised boxing match at Madison Square Garden on March 24, 1962. Emile Griffith and Benny Paret, immigrants from Saint Thomas and Cuba, respectively, battled for the welterweight title. Paret was gravely hurt and died from his injuries ten days later. \n\r\nVintage fight posters, with the two fighters\u2019 names clearly visible, make up the background of Convention Hall. Two ghostly falling stars, portraits of sorts, perhaps allude to the hardships both men experienced, in and out of the ring.",

Here Attie adapts two famous works by the American painter Thomas Eakins, Max Schmitt in a Single Scull, 1871, and The Gross Clinic, 1875. Her text documents the uproar caused when Eakins, a professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, allowed female students to attend life classes with nude male models. She points out the hypocrisy of Victorian society, which took offense at not only the frank representation of a surgeon\u2019s bloodied hands, but also the idea of women observing and understanding male anatomy.",

            "description": "Hellen van Meene\u2019s photograph is an illuminating example of this young Dutch photographer\u2019s practice of portraiture. The young woman looks away from the viewer, her body contorted, as if frozen in a movement to shield herself from invading gazes. Light streams through a window from outside the picture, falling softly on her pale skin. It highlights not only her dyed blond hair but also her shoulder blade, oddly jutting out, unsettling the contour and emphasizing her thin frame. The partial shadow reveals the texture of the skin, including goose pimples and the deep impression of a bra. \n\r\nLike her fellow Dutch portraitist Rineke Dijkstra, van Meene focuses on transitional states, usually, in van Meene's case, the pubescent girl, her vulnerability and doubts, poised somewhere between childhood and womanhood. As with many of van Meene's subjects, this adolescent has been posed by the artist to play a role. Interested in the dramatic potential of portraiture, in the tradition of artists such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Claude Cahun, van Meene does not intend to objectively document her subjects nor to catch their personalities, but rather, with the help of her models, to create a certain mood. Selecting subjects among young people she knows in her neighborhood as well as teenagers she meets on the street when traveling, van Meene carefully stages her pictures. Usually set in a shallow space, close to the picture plane, the models are prepared down to the smallest detail: make-up; wardrobe, if any; the pose; the direction of the gaze. And in this case, the little flower that just makes it into the picture in the lower right corner.",

She uses marquetry, a woodworking technique dating from the Renaissance, to depict a dilapidated tract house amid an unkempt yard. Selecting wood veneers in a variety of grains and earthy desert tones, she embellishes the scene with details that suggest narratives relating to housing foreclosures and fears about border security. Security House taps into a long-standing romance with the American frontier, while also suggesting the persistence of boom-and-bust cycles that have historically characterized towns in the West.",

While the photograph\u2019s large scale monumentalizes the subject, Serrano depicts his sitter in a direct and dignified manner, producing a sense of engaging intimacy. Serrano has explored fundamental issues related to sex, religion, race, and prejudice throughout his career. Whatever his subject matter, he always considers himself a portraitist. He has often expressed his admiration of both August Sander, the 1920s chronicler of people in various segments of German society, and Edward S. Curtis, who in the early twentieth century aimed at documenting the disappearance of traditional life among the indigenous peoples of North America. Curtis has been criticized for fabricating a false reality, staging scenes and retouching his photographs to conform to a stereotypical idea of traditional Native culture. To Serrano, however, it is the sense of dignity in Curtis\u2019s depictions that matters, and this quality comes through in his own portrait of Lyndell Yazzie.",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u00e2\u0080\u0094the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

            "description": "Leon Polk Smith was born in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) a century ago. After receiving a Masters in Art Education at Columbia University in 1938, he had his first one-person exhibition in 1941. Since then his work has been featured in countless exhibitions worldwide.An admirer of the abstract paintings of Piet Mondrian, Smith decided early in his career to dispense with the recognizable object as part of his paintings. In the mid-1940s he began painting abstract compositions based on the relationships of basic geometric elements, which he gradually reduced to a minimum.Jubilee, one of Smith's late works, is an extreme example of this economy of means. The four lines seem to move across the canvas, suggesting spatial relationships and depth of field. The painting illustrates well a statement of the artist's creative principles that he wrote in 1961: \"Three elements which interested me in art are line, color, and the concept of space and its use as a positive force.\"",

Both objects are testaments to the long-standing global nature of African religions, ideas, and art. \n\r\nThe stone sculpture represents Serapis, a composite god created early in the Ptolemaic (Greek) rule of Egypt to unite Greeks and Egyptians. The deity combined aspects of Egyptian gods (especially Osiris, the ruler of the Underworld) with Greek deities (particularly Zeus, the king of the gods). Worship of Serapis continued in the Roman period and eventually spread to Europe. \n\r\nThe painting depicts al-Buraq, the winged horse with a woman's head on which the prophet Muhammad flew the mi'raj, his nocturnal journey to heaven to meet God. Like many in Senegal, Gora Mbengue was a member of a Sufi order, a group dedicated to the practice of a mystical interpretation of Islam. Sufism played an important role in the spread of Islam in West Africa, inspiring schools and movements particularly open to melding new and existing systems of belief and image making. Reverse glass painting (souw\u00e8re) developed by 1900 in Senegal's cities, as pilgrims on the hajj to Mecca brought the technique back from the eastern Mediterranean.",

            "description": "As she has done in the past, Nina Abney here creates a highly personal, imaginative, and eclectic interpretation of a literary source. Forbidden Fruit, part of a series inspired by Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice in Wonderland, alludes to the chapter featuring a hookah-puffing caterpillar. According to the artist, the composition of the figures and the choice of light blue and green were drawn from Henri Matisse\u2019s 1909 painting The Dance. Sea-Monkeys (a species of brine shrimp sold as curiosities during the artist\u2019s childhood) provided the model for the two figures with antennae sitting on the left, and the numbers that appear on various figures also have personal meaning for Abney. Though the original Alice is absent here, Abney\u2019s boldly hued hallucinatory scene populated by fantastic creatures vividly simulates the magical environment of the text, in which Alice experiments with mushrooms that allow her to grow and shrink in size.",

The hieroglyphic inscription on this figure is a spell from the Book of the Dead, asking the shabti to do the Nubian king Senkamanisken\u2019s work for him in the afterlife. \n\r\nOwusu-Ankomah's paintings depict a spiritual world occupied by people and symbols. The male figure in this work is covered by, and moves within, Akan adinkra symbols from the artist's native Ghana, each of which graphically represents a particular concept or proverb. Looking Back Into the Future depicts a nude man with his head turned backward, in a pose associated with the Akan proverbial concept of sankofa (\"one must know the past to know the future\"). \n\r\nYou can see a contemporary version of adinkra cloth among the \"touch\" textiles around the corner.",

            "description": "ART OF PORTRAITS\r\nWhile Western artists have historically often attempted to represent a person exactly how they look, many African artists instead have created portraits based on a specific physical or personality feature of the subject. \n\r\nThis terracotta head, most likely depicting the oni, or king, of ancient Ife, shows that Yoruba sculpture was already highly developed a thousand years ago. Ife court art interprets the human figure with extraordinary naturalism. This head, however, is not intended to be truly representational or realistic. It shows the oni in the prime of life, with no imperfections. \n\nFiegnon is composed chiefly of a discarded oil jerry can. Although Fiegnon may appear to resemble a mask, Romuald Hazoum\u00e9 has noted that his works are, in fact, portraits\u2014of particular individuals or of social types. With its long braids, this work represents a Fulani man Hazoum\u00e9 met fishing in the lagoon where he found the oilcan. \n\r\nThe striking differences in style and materials in these two portraits may also reflect a marked gap in status and power between their two subjects.",
