It brings together photographs from various traditions\u2014including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary\u2014as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story\u2014sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.",

The Plains woman\u2019s dress featured prominently in the painting is worn by those in the Ghost Dance Religion to recall the vision of John Wilson (better known as Wovoka), who prophesied that white people would vanish and Native Americans would return to take back the land that was once theirs. The religious movement offered hope to many homeless, ill, and hungry Native Americans, and its message and surrounding tensions are, according to the artist, conveyed through various elements in this work: the eagle appears as a messenger of the prophecy; bingo cards are meant to represent the Catholic Church\u2019s introduction of gambling to reservations; and written texts convey the \u201cQueen of Hearts\u201d children\u2019s rhyme, a reference to power.",

Drawing upon her Catholic upbringing, Smith uses the Annunciation\u2014the angel Gabriel\u2019s revelation to the Virgin Mary that she will conceive Jesus\u2014as a metaphor for the moment of creative inspiration.",

Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-\u00c0-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist\u2019s gilded \u201cTG\u201d monogram.

This \u201cplay set\u201d even seems to suggest that the cast of characters and their settings could be reorganized, creating new narratives that revolve around issues of oppression and power, race and gender, and moral ambiguity.",

The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.\n\r\nThe Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.",

He spent nearly ten years, for example, on a series of sculptures dedicated to the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black aviators\u2014named for their base in Tuskegee, Alabama\u2014who during World War II became the first African American military pilots in the history of the United States. For this particular sculpture, as with others in the series, Richards made a fiberglass mold of his own body and then pierced the work with nails (other sculptures in the series are impaled by toy airplanes). The sculpture thus refers both to Christian iconography (St. Sebastian, depicted with a body full of arrows) and to African objects known as nkisi nkondi.\nIn a tragic and eerie twist of fate, Michael Richards was working as an artist-In-residence with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council at its studios in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001, and died in the attack on Tower 1. He did not live to witness the surviving Tuskegee Airmen receive the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal, on March 29, 2007.",

The bulbous stockings twist and strain under the weight of the sand they contain, calling to mind both the rhythm of a swinging pendulum and exposed internal organs. The work also conjures the image of a traditional African headdress, telling of Nengudi\u2019s interest in African philosophy and ritual. The artist\u2019s background as a dancer and choreographer informs her practice, and she has often utilized works such as Inside/Outside in her own performances, testing the limit of her constructions by wearing and stretching the nylons to the brink of bursting.",

Vivid evidence of Coble\u2019s harrowing artistic process appears in this photograph. As the fresh needle punctures imprinted names on her lower leg, the artist\u2019s blood mingled with an older ink tattoo, a rainbow-hued chain of figures emblematic of a diverse community. This documentary photograph shows Coble\u2019s body as a locus for reflection on both the physical nature of assaults inflicted on hate-crime victims and the reporting of their deaths. The artist\u2019s preparatory research revealed that anti-gay words were carved into some of the victims\u2019 skin. She also discovered that no centralized database exists for hatecrime statistics, since individual states are not required to report hate-crime deaths to the FBI or any other federal agency.",

Made up of five portrait heads of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, Grey Area (Brown Version) refers to one of the most copied works of ancient civilization. The otherwise identical plaster effigies, which he purchased and painted, illustrate a value scale ranging in color from oatmeal to dark chocolate. Thus, Wilson raises, but does not answer, controversial questions about the racial identity of ancient Egyptians. \n\r\nIn both his provocative, groundbreaking installations in cultural institutions and in his studio work, Wilson encourages viewers to recognize how changes in context create changes in meaning.

She draws inspiration from images of iconic African American women, emblems of the Black Power Movement, and her mother\u2019s photographs from the 1970s. Here, she casts an African American woman as leading lady in an updated version of an established visual archetype\u2014a sexualized female subject seemingly caught unaware as she reclines passively in her own beauty. In doing so, the artist turns the historic nude on its head and ousts the white European woman from the bed where she often lounges, attended by a black maidservant, in Western art.",

The bristling blades of toy sabers suggest might and power. With this work, Locke, who was born in Britain and raised in Guyana, explores tensions between contemporary British society and its colonial past. The title refers to the Koh-i-noor diamond, a legendary treasure dating back to fourteenth-century India. Once the largest diamond in the world, it passed through the hands of Sikh, Mughal, and Persian rulers as a highly prized spoil of war. In 1877 the British government declared Queen Victoria the Empress of India, and the diamond entered the British Crown Jewels collection.",

Displaying works like this within the Egyptian Galleries allows visitors to participate in the ongoing dialogue that artists have pursued with the ancients, as they have expressed their stake in ancient history and its continuing relevance. \n\r\nLorraine O\u2019Grady\u2019s photographs grew out of a 1980 performance called Nefertiti/Devonia Evangeline, which took place in front of a series of projected images similar to the ones seen here. The work examined the troubled relationship between O\u2019Grady and her deceased sister, Devonia Evangeline, through juxtaposed portraits of the Egyptian queens Nefertiti and Mutnedjmet, of a later reign, proposed by some scholars to be Nefertiti\u2019s sister. Though the subject matter is deeply personal, it allows O\u2019Grady to address issues of class, racism, ethnography, and African American art. Thus, as the artist says, her work attempts to \u201cmake the historic personal and the personal historic.\u201d",

            "description": "Wendell Castle, one of America\u2019s most important contemporary furniture makers, has had several distinct stylistic phases in his career. At first he employed both exotic and native American woods to produce furniture characterized by biomorphic forms and attenuated surrealism. By the 1960s, he had begun experimenting with plastic and fiberglass to create seamless organic designs. In the 1980s, he became fascinated with Post-Modernism and produced highly architectural, polychromatic designs. In 2007 he received the Brooklyn Museum/Modernism Lifetime Achievement Award. The Nirvana chair was a gift of the artist in acknowledgment of the Museum\u2019s ongoing commitment to his work.",

In creating these monumental paintings, Wiley borrows poses, imagery, and titles from works by master painters such as Tiepolo (1727\u20131804). Dressed in their everyday clothes, the figures float over flat, brightly colored backgrounds suggestive of infinite space. By placing these \"new\" subjects within the context of art history, Wiley challenges the prevailing representations of black men in contemporary American society.",

            "description": "Jules de Balincourt\u2019s monumental painting Not Yet Titled continues a tradition of portraying dramatic landscapes that characterized the Hudson River School of painters. Unlike his predecessors, whose elaborate studio canvases drew on specific details of actual sites, here de Balincourt favors a generic touristic landscape with a steep waterfall that empties into a body of water ringed by palm trees. Tiny figures in boats enhance the atmosphere of leisure-time pleasure, which is set against the forces of nature. Utilizing a flat, painterly, almost intentionally na\u00efve technique of painting, de Balincourt can be regarded as part of a general revival of painting that began to occur in the early twenty-first century. The acquisition of Not Yet Titled will initiate an intriguing dialogue between contemporary practice and the distinguished nineteenth-century American landscape paintings in the collection. Born in France and educated in the United States, de Balincourt is based in Brooklyn.",

            "description": "George Bradford Brainerd\u2019s photograph of Fourth Avenue, close to the southern edge of Brooklyn\u2019s Park Slope neighborhood, shows the low-cost dwellings lining the street in the late nineteenth century. Crowded tenement buildings replaced the shanties about 1900, and until recently the wide and heavily trafficked avenue retained much of its neglected character. Over the last few years, however, gentrification reached this lower section of Park Slope, and the old tenement buildings are now being razed or upgraded to make space for more expensive housing.\n\r\nFurther south, Red Hook is undergoing a similar transformation. With easy access to the open sea, Red Hook became a busy industrial area in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, dominated by the activities of the port and inexpensive housing for workers of local businesses. By the time of Lynn Saville\u2019s photograph in the late 1990s, however, many of the industrial structures had long been abandoned and artists and artisans were occupying the former warehouses. The demolition earlier this year of the sugar refinery in the background of Saville\u2019s picture signals the definite turn of the neighborhood in a new direction. An explosion of residential and retail construction and a recently inaugurated cruise-ship terminal are examples of the contentious redevelopment of the area.",
