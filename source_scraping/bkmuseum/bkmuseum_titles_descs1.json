It brings together photographs from various traditions\u2014including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary\u2014as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story\u2014sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.",

The potential for transformation that occurs with this material is echoed here by themes of migration and social change suggested by the covered wagon, part of the collective memory and mythology of American culture.",

While his own practice always led to materialized works, he defined his artistic method as Conceptual, because he would always start from an idea, often permutations of a basic form or repetition of an operation, which he called the \u201cmachine that makes the art.\u201d These two sketches show him elaborating the multiple forms of open cubes, and some of the various configurations possible for parallel straight lines.",

In both the lift and turn of the young man\u2019s head and the open V of his zippered collar, this bronze refers to an eighteenth-century marble bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon (see illustration).\n\r\nYet in many other ways, Wiley\u2019s work could hardly be more different: in substituting male for female, black for white, and present for past, he upends the earlier sculpture even as he quotes it. His radical reinterpretation encourages us to examine the stereotypes that can be found in portraiture.\n\r\n\u2014Rujeko Hockley, Assistant Curator, Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum",

Displayed together, Lesperance\u2019s painting and sweater engage this activist history, literally and metaphorically offering a pattern for a new generation.",

Constructed out of common building materials including wallboard, paint, and joint compound, this large panel resembles an actual section of a wall with a doorway flanked by cupboards. \n\r\nThe image is enigmatic, in a number of ways: The wall could be in the process of either construction or demolition, the place either real or imaginary. Moreover, the muted tones and streamlined aesthetic recall both Bauhaus design and Minimalist sculpture. And, as both object and image, R.T.P.18.B straddles the categories of sculpture and painting. Whatever the object\u2019s significance, the artist\u2019s experience as a carpenter informs the subject and materials of his work.",

Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life.

The artist\u2019s bold approach combines traditional block settings with free-flowing improvisation and a masterful use of color. In the late 1980s, Williams\u2019s unique style of quilt-making was recognized by artists and collectors, who encouraged her to exhibit and sell her work.",

Dressed in a fedora and a man\u2019s white satin suit, she strikes a series of poses evoking the style of 1970s fashion photography and then strips, cleverly suggesting bride and bachelor simultaneously. In her self-conscious affectation of a fashion model, Wilke willfully uses her own image and her sexuality to confront the erotic representation of women in art history and popular culture.",

Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculptures\r\nproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works\u2014the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.\n\r\nCoyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.",

            "description": "As suggested by her assumed name, the artist known as Swoon is an admirer of urban art like that featured in the special exhibition Graffiti, on view elsewhere on this floor. Trained in printmaking in Prague and at Brooklyn\u2019s Pratt Institute, she decided to take her own art to the streets in l999, pasting her large linoleum- and woodcuts, printed on thin paper, on the sides of the industrial buildings of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side.\n\r\nThe artist\u2019s main subjects are the people of the city, often her family members and friends but also strangers. \u201cI go and look at people hanging out on the street,\u201d she says. \u201cSo what I wind up with is actually a street scene\u2014a portrait of the city.\u201d\n\r\nRecently, Swoon has begun creating large, intricate installations in which layers of printed and cutout material projecting into space are supplemented by objects found in the street. Brooklyn Museum Installation is a site-specific work based on a 2003 piece called Coney Island Cyclone, after the landmark Brooklyn roller coaster. The artist translates the coaster\u2019s image into an intricate web of printed fragments. The lacelike appearance reveals influences as various as Indonesian shadow puppets and the printing methods of German Expressionism.\n\r\nThe artist\u2019s attraction to Coney Island derives from an all-American fascination with this place of wonder, magic, and bizarre personages. For Swoon, who was born in Florida, Coney Island encapsulates New York and its never-ending surprises, possibilities, and mystery.",

Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story\u2014sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life.

The bands around the jar, referred to as rainbows, are also considered prayers, to keep the water from evaporating.

Though infused with nostalgia, Red Indian #4 also invokes the violence that permeates both popular childhood games and the history of indigenous peoples in North America. \n\r\nTo create his sculpture, Wolberger took molds of toy figurines\u2014objects that were themselves based on stock images of Native Americans in nineteenth-century landscape paintings of America\u2019s wilderness. Such imagery helped to foster perceptions among non-Natives of Indians as uncivilized, hostile, and an impediment to national progress defined by westward expansion. \n\r\nThe irregular \u201cfins\u201d around the edges of Wolberger\u2019s sculpture, which mimic the seams of their mass-produced toy counterparts, symbolize the continuing proliferation of standardized images of Native Americans and the American frontier. Moreover, the lack of detail and the generic character of his warrior underscore the ways in which stereotypes deny historical circumstances and ignore the diversity of Native peoples.",

            "description": "Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design \r\nis manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not \r\nalways the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",
