Locke\u2019s particular encouragement of art that celebrated black physical types and African ancestral traditions led Johnson to refer to African sculpture in the masklike form of the face. Employing a modernist reduction of form in the simplified, cylindrical body, Johnson created a work that exudes a quiet gravity and power. At midcentury, Abstract Expressionist artists including Adolph Gottlieb (whose work hangs to the right) used African-inspired forms to achieve similar effects.",

Unlike the sentimental, private objects of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, revival miniatures functioned as aesthetic objects in their own right. In addition, artists emulated contemporary trends in full-scale oil painting, including loose brushwork and an interest in allover decorative patterns. The Brooklyn Museum led the way in institutional collecting of modern miniatures with the 1931 acquisition of seventeen works; as a result, the Museum\u2019s holdings are especially strong in revival examples.",

In images of cities, landscapes, and intimate portraits (mostly of his wife, Eleanor, and his daughter, Barbara), he often experimented with graphic abstraction, always infused with a personal expression. This early portrait of Eleanor combines his exploration of light with his interest in line and form. Eleanor\u2019s face is seen in profile against the trunk of a tree. Shadows of foliage overlay her face, and the stark contrasts contribute to the flatness of the image. The Museum holds several of Callahan\u2019s portraits of Eleanor and Barbara, as well as many cityscapes and landscapes, a large number of them in color.",

The ship, which soon achieved the record for the fastest Atlantic crossing, cost a staggering seventy-eight million dollars and was noteworthy for its extensive use of aluminum and its modern d\u00e9cor. The Troy Sunshade Company was an American firm that pioneered the manufacture of tubular steel furniture in the 1930s and then aluminum furniture in the postwar period. Hundreds of these chairs were made for the liner and remained with the ship until 1984, when the fittings and furniture were auctioned. The ship is now docked in Philadelphia awaiting refurbishment.",

His work became abstract and metaphoric in the early 1940s, and he cultivated friendships with such Abstract Expressionist painters as Franz Kline, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, and Mark Rothko. Siskind\u2019s photographs of graffiti, peeling plaster, sections of signs, road surfaces, and found objects marked a decisive shift in his work; exploring the properties of the medium, he flattened the picture plane, paid close attention to tonal gradation, and often drastically cropped the image. \n\nGloucester 16A was made during a prolific period in Gloucester, Massachusetts, during the summers of 1944 and 1945. In many photographs from the Gloucester series, the shapes are unrecognizable and the shallow space is extremely compressed. This image elevates a simple section of wall into a totemic figure. Like a strange, rural Rorschach blot, the circular opening, a black void, suggests both an eye and a peephole.",

Such works were made using the lost-wax casting method, in which a clay mold was made around a modeled wax form. The mold was then heated and the wax poured out. Finally, molten gold was poured into the mold to create a form in the shape of the original wax model.",

The ram's head commonly denotes power among the Dan, but it may also refer to the use of rams as sacrifices at the feasts over which a wunkirle presides.",

The artist, who endured decades of poverty and hunger in order to pursue her career, produced works characterized by somber dignity and idealized but expressive facial features. This sculpture is one of only about a dozen known works by Prophet still in existence.",

            "description": "Consuelo Kanaga, one of the pioneers of modern American photography, began her career as a photojournalist in 1915 in San Francisco. In the 1920s, Alfred Stieglitz inspired her to develop a more aesthetic approach, and a trip to Europe in 1928 awakened her lifelong preoccupation with European modernist painting and the ways in which that work was influenced by the sculpture of Africa. Kanaga successfully combined a Pictorialist aesthetic with a realist strategy, producing handsomely composed and carefully printed images. She was one of few white American photographers in the 1930s to make artistic portraits of African Americans.\n\r\nIn Frances with a Flower, the focus is so sharp that the slightly rough texture of the woman\u2019s skin, shiny with perspiration at the hairline, seems palpable. The forehead, nose, and cheeks, highlighted by flash, contrast with the deep-set eyes lost in shadow, thus producing a sculptural dimension that turns the photograph into hills and valleys of light. The stark white blossom pressed to the woman\u2019s nose emphasizes the sensuality of her face.\n\r\nThe Brooklyn Museum held large retrospective exhibitions of Kanaga\u2019s work in 1976 and 1993 and holds several hundred of her images in its collection.",

These two masks performed instructional and critical messages about proper behavior and political discontent. \n\r\nMale Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. This mask depicts a French gendarme, a colonial soldier, and was most likely performed as a critique of French personal and political behavior during the colonial period. \n\r\nThe mask depicting Elvis Presley belonged to the Nyau society (to which all Chewa men belong), an institution that governs the spiritual realm of death and the ancestors. The society\u2019s masks always represent the spirits of the deceased, but they may also represent wild bush spirits or caricature personalities from the wider community.

As C\u00e9zanne had done, Hartley depicted the distinctive profile of Mont Sainte-Victoire repeatedly. In this spare drawing, he captured the stark monumentality and sculptural contours of the mountain while using a flatter and more economical treatment for the foreground valley, where he incorporated large areas of blank paper and rendered structures in faceted planes that evoke C\u00e9zanne\u2019s style. Although Hartley was working in front of the natural motif, he envisioned this landscape through the lens of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s art.",

Here he reduced the body to a flattened outline of sinuous curves, relying on the expressive quality of his line to animate the figure. Inspired by his wife and muse, Lachaise presented a new feminine ideal that endowed the classical Venus type with modernist forms and earthy sexuality.",

In that medium he began to experience the pure pleasure of painting with a liberated, almost calligraphic touch bearing no relation to the lurid tones and laboriously worked surfaces of his German oil paintings.",

Although figurative, these paintings accentuate the geometry underlying the elements of the city's infrastructure and thus prefigure Rothko's later concentration on rectangular shapes of luminous colors in his celebrated abstract paintings.",

Sevruguin\u2019s photographic portraits are often recognized by a skillful manipulation of light and a keen attention to capturing aspects of the sitter\u2019s personality.\n\r\nThe portraits reveal some of the effects of Iran\u2019s exposure to European culture in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. The two soldiers\u2019 uniforms suggest how Iranian costume gradually incorporated European modes of dress. At right, Mirza Husayn Khan and Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir, the famed prime minister to Nasir al-Din Shah (later executed by the same ruler), are shown posing in elegant European suits. Their powerful political positions are countered by Sevruguin\u2019s use of soft light.",

During the 1940s he became a devoted and influential teacher, especially of the first and second generations of Abstract Expressionists. In Towering Spaciousness, the artist combines strictly defined geometric forms with thickly applied, gestural areas of orange, blue, yellow, pink, and green. Blocks of color are built into towering spatial intervals. Indeed this painting well represents the artist's \"push-and-pull\" theory. In considering the spatial relations he created on the picture plane, Hofmann wrote in 1948: \"Push and pull are expanding and contracting forces which are activated by carriers in visual motion. Planes are the most important carriers, lines and point less so.\"",

One of only a handful of internationally known female sculptors in America at the time, Scudder studied in Paris and became the first woman employed at the Paris studio of the sculptor Frederick MacMonnies. \n\r\nShe later made a name for herself crafting ornamental sculptures for the formal gardens of estates designed by the architect Stanford White. Admired by White, whose firm designed the Brooklyn Museum, Scudder was even selected as the only female to produce a sculpture, Japanese Art, for the Museum\u2019s facade.",

Edward's identification of his sitter as a Dakota, or a Sioux, is meaningful because the Sioux retained perhaps the most lasting hold on white imaginations owing to the charismatic Ghost Dance movement. Inspired by the visions of a Paiute Indian, a wave of the Sioux communities began the practice of the Ghost Dance in the late nineteenth century to bring about the return of legions of their dead and of Sioux lands to their natural state. White fears of the movement's emotional force ultimately led to the murder of Sitting Bull and the violent confrontation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1890.",

In contrast to the cool objectivity of images by his Precisionist colleagues such as Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth, Ault\u2019s works often resonate with melancholic emotion, evident here in the dead trees, barren field, and moody sky.",
