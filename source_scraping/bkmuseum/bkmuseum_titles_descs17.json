In this work, which suggests the ribbon-like meander of a Western river through arid terrain, her reference to place is almost entirely subsumed by the force of the calligraphic, abstract design.",

The number of feast spoons was determined by the magnificence of the feast the family could afford. This Haida spoon was delicately carved from a single piece of goat horn and decorated with five animal heads, each with abalone-shell eyes. Before carving, the horn was steamed until pliable, bent into shape, and cooled in a mold.",

By the late nineteenth century, the shape was enlarged for the thriving art market. Exact meanings of each design have been lost, but figures depicted with horns, as seen here, usually refer to power coming from or going to the sky. The woven, interlocking forms of light and dark suggest the Apache belief of complete harmony with all elements of the universe.\n\n\r\nEsta cesta de almacenaje tejida hace eco de la forma de las ollas de agua Pueblo.

In the early 1920s, before turning to painting, Yasuo Kuniyoshi embraced the traditional Eastern practice of ink drawing, yet he manipulated the medium in unconventional ways, creating a range of textures and tones through the varied application of broad washes and delicate lines.",

However, the Native American artist who carved this figure was following the formal artistic traditions of Kwakwaka'wakw society. Potlatch figures were place outside a chief's large house during a potlatch to emphasize his power. At a potlatch, a celebration held for occasions such as births, deaths, marriages, and treaty signings, the chief gave away much of his valuable belongings to the attendees, affirming his wealth and power and obligating the recipients to reciprocate at some future time.",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.",

Incorporating outside materials, they each reflect how both a colonial past and global exchange shaped shifting ideas about local identity. \n\r\nEven this bead-embroidered crown, the ultimate symbol of Yoruba kingship, is the product of a complex global story. Although the Yoruba have a long history of glassmaking, the large, multicolored ade crown depicts figures wearing bowler hats and contains beads imported by the British in the late nineteenth century into what would soon become the Nigeria colony. The smaller beaded crown, known as an or\u00edk\u00f2gb\u00f2f\u00f3, is an evolution of the ade form, but it is modeled after the wig of a British barrister (lawyer), still worn in court today by members of the Nigerian judiciary. \n\r\nYinka Shonibare, a British artist of Yoruba and Nigerian descent, used Dutch wax-printed fabric to create Skipping Girl. This material\u2014a commodity associated with Africa but actually created in Europe, based on Indonesian designs, and sold in West Africa\u2014serves as a symbol of the web of economic and cultural interrelationships among Africa, Asia, and Europe. Shonibare exposes cultural \"authenticity\" as an illusion and evokes the layers of historical connections among global cultures.",

The central seated figure holds a tabar, a small ceremonial axe, while each of the remaining men holds a walking staff, another iconic Sufi attribute. The extremely long beards of the male members identify this group as part of the Ahl-i Haqq order of Sufis, whose practices are guarded with extreme secrecy.

The Brooklyn Bridge was an iconic subject for her generation of modern artists, but she had never painted it before. She used the twin arches and harp-like cables of the bridge to create a valentine to the things she was leaving behind, saying goodbye to Stieglitz, their partnership, and the city where they launched their careers. The bridge is also a gateway, perhaps her metaphor for leaving the manmade city of stone and steel for the clear blue skies of New Mexico.",
