One was commissioned to resolve a personal trauma, while the other represents a viscerally remembered social upheaval from the colonial era. \n\r\nFigures like this mother and child were believed to offer protection, through the intervention of spirits, by the Bwanga Bwa Cibola society. When a woman lost successive children through miscarriages or early infant death, she could be initiated into the society to protect herself from ominous forces suspected to be the cause of the deaths. This emotionally gripping figure is considered to be one of the great masterpieces of African art. \n\r\nTshibumba's painting depicts the slaughter of striking mineworkers in Lubumbashi at the order of the Belgian colonial government on December 9, 1941. The artist critiques the institutions complicit in the colonial system: Belgium (represented by the flag), the church, the mining company, the colonial governor (with arm raised), and the Congolese soldiers in the colonial army. Following independence in 1960, a market for narrative painting developed among urban Congolese who were working in mining factories and living in new, Western-style homes.",

The main subject here is the river itself, meandering through the entire image. On its banks, caught amid tangled vegetation, are the remains of former human habitation; we are witnessing the brutal results of forced displacement. Eventually, the coming flood will submerge this scene.\n\r\nDespite the highly contemporary references, the artist has chosen to use traditional Chinese techniques and visual symbolism. He uses layered mulberry paper, applying ink, watercolor, and mineral pigments, and often distresses the paper by overworking it.",

This image captures a rare moment where she wanted to make a portrait of me with her and her dolls. I set up one light and ran a cable release behind my back. There was nobody present but Grandma Ruby and me. We both quietly sat up and looked over our shoulders into the lens. I pressed the cable release, and the shutter clicked for nearly one second. \n\r\n\u2014LaToya Ruby Frazier\n\r\n[Text not currently in gallery]",

Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-\u00c0-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist\u2019s gilded \u201cTG\u201d monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.",

Hegarty was drawn to the way nineteenth-century landscape artists depicted vast expanses of wilderness as an expression of \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d the notion that the United States was divinely entitled to expand across the entire North American continent. In Fallen Bierstadt the \u201ccanvas\u201d appears to decay, as if affected by the ravages of nature.

Following the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976), he entered the Jiangsu Chinese Painting Institute to gain formal training. Meticulous brushwork and subtle gradations in ink tones are hallmarks of his painting style.This monumental painting depicts a Taihu rock, or spirit stone, a variety of limestone appreciated by Chinese connoisseurs for the way it suggests a landscape in miniature. The rock's combination of abstract forms and voided space also recalls Chinese calligraphy. These stones were often installed in gardens or on the desks of scholars as focal points for meditation. In the hands of a contemporary artist, the traditional Taihu rock form becomes a modernist abstraction.",

It brings together photographs from various traditions\u2014including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary\u2014as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story\u2014sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.",

After his move to New York in 1946 and a decisive turn to abstraction, he executed numerous landscapes such as this one, in which the forms are intended to convey the character of a particular place and time of day.",

In the course of her career, Rady began to focus on the sculptural aspects of her work rather than the utilitarian features usually associated with the vessel form. In 1990 she began to assemble her pieces in groups of various sizes. The works of her Still Life series are tableaux in which the individual pieces relate to each other very much as objects in traditional still-life paintings do. In Still Life IV two distinctly different vessels are paired on an aluminum shelf that is attached to a rectangular backdrop, which suggests the clearly defined pictorial plane of a painting.",

Vincent Cianni\u2019s 1995 image captures a graceful moment of a teenage boy midair. \n\r\nThe backgrounds of these images reveal changing textures of the neighborhood landscapes: felt hats with fur trim and arched glass storefront windows in the former, and baggy T-shirts and graffiti scrawled along a block in the latter. Although taken forty-five years apart, these photographs display skating as a communal and enjoyed act for Brooklyn youth.",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.\nIn 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior \r\nItalian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro \r\nMendini. Memphis pieces were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the \r\npostmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted \r\nonly for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries \r\nof modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.",

The name of the series is a play on jalousie, a colloquial French word for window louvers or blinds, and a nod to the novel La Jalousie, by one of the artist\u2019s favorite authors, Alain Robbe-Grillet. Blinds playfully questions the Renaissance concept of paintings as windows that offer a glimpse of other worlds, contiguous with ours. With its edges brushed gold to simulate a picture frame or, even, a window frame, Blinds nevertheless asserts its identity as a planar object.",

Here, the figure\u2019s bullet-shaped head exaggerates his phallic power and capacity for violence. However, by depicting him as a paper doll, to be dressed up as an executioner, decorated soldier, policeman, or butcher, Stevens ultimately strips Big Daddy of his patriarchal command.",

This unlikely combination demonstrates his interest in multiplicities of both inspiration and interpretation.",

In her pieces she combines traditional techniques and materials with her own innovations, constantly crossing the boundaries between fine arts and crafts to extend the possibilities of ceramics. Still-Life Vase #10, from a series begun in 1990, displays the boldness of this artist\u2019s approach. A fully developed large vase is the core of the piece, but its form gets almost obliterated by the dramatically painted surface. Large protruding wings, or handles, attached at the sides are themselves shaped as incomplete, flat vessels adorned with handles and other protrusions. Thus, the piece presents an arrangement of objects in space, a fundamental feature of the still-life genre in visual art.",

Apfelbaum paints with dyes on rectangles of crushed velvet that are then folded, showing the underlying layers of colors, and placed on cardboard boxes. The boxes function as pedestals for the painted velvet, integrating painting and sculpture in a single work. According to Apfelbaum, the box is a metaphor for the artist\u2019s paint box as well as for the painted wedding chest, which historically held the trousseau that defined a woman\u2019s standing in society.

The words sit on the picture plane, creating a play between the painting as a flat surface and as a window opening onto the illusion of deep space. Lined up on a wall, the Sunday Paintings have a cinematic quality: each panel looks like a frame in a film sequence\u2014a moment in time stilled\u2014as if each is a part of a larger ongoing whole. While the works were created on Sundays, the title of this series also refers to amateurs known as \u201cSunday painters,\u201d admired by Kim for the purity of their motives in making art.",

            "description": "Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design \r\nis manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not \r\nalways the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

For the sky, he matches thick layers of blue, gray, and white pigment with expanses of paper prepared with a light base or ground coat of paint.

Writing about her work, Morton referred to \u201cthe responsibility of the artist . . . to be free, and while in that freedom, to look, and to see while looking, and to feel, and to respond while feeling, and to be romantic, and to love the romance.\u201d",

They were also created through very similar techniques, in which the artist built up the form from thin coils of clay to produce a hollow vessel that could be further sculpted and fired. \n\r\nThe head from the Nok culture is an archaeological fragment, possibly once part of a full figure. One of the oldest pieces in the African collection, it was found at one of the earliest known iron-smelting sites in Africa. \n\r\nMagdalene Odundo, a contemporary artist drawing on the global history of pottery, used an understated anthropomorphic vocabulary to create this abstract, burnished vessel that evokes the female form. Odundo achieved the black, smoky finish by covering her pots with a clay slip and firing them in a closed kiln with combustible materials such as wood chips. \n\r\nSince pottery has long been associated with women\u2019s work across the African continent, some scholars have speculated that female artists created the ancient Nok statuary. It is thus possible that the two works displayed here\u2014among the African collection's oldest and newest, respectively\u2014may both be by women artists.",

            "description": "Thomas E. Warren\u2019s \u201cCentripetal Spring\u201d chair is the forerunner of Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf\u2019s Aeron chair, designed nearly 150 years later. Both are made principally of metal, raised on casters for mobility, rotate on a central column, and allow for adjustment of the angle of the seat. The very different look of the chairs suggests the ways that consumer attitudes toward industrial invention and modernity have evolved over the centuries. Although Warren\u2019s chair bears a patent mark (on the bottom of the seat), he felt the need to mitigate the newness of his invention by concealing its ingenious metal spring system beneath a dense, soft curtain of luxurious passementerie (elaborate trim). Similarly, he disguised his progressive use of cast iron for the frame by rendering it in the backward-looking Rococo Revival style and gilding it. In contrast, the makers of the Aeron chair reveal its mechanical elements, celebrate its recycled man-made materials, and use a monochromatic black to underline the seriousness of the design, all without fear of losing customers.",

In contrast to his preceding, figurative group of works, this new series of abstract images allowed the artist to employ, as he put it, \"an allover light which wasn't possible in the representational works, which seem somewhat dingy by comparison.\" In Ocean Park No.27, Diebenkorn reduces the scene to planes and fragments of color. Depth and spatial illusion are suggested by the color's changing density and the composition's system of receding lines. Using a low-key palette devoid of harsh tones, the artist accomplishes his stated goal of communicating \"a feeling of strength in reserve, tension beneath calm.\"",

This piece, the fifth in the series, is composed of appropriated imagery, including musical notes and song lyrics taken from 1920s game boards given to the artist by her mother. It depicts laboring slaves as well as Civil War soldiers, languid antebellum women, cotton fields, steamships, trains, churches, and other period structures. Words from slave songs and Bible hymns, and texts about \u201cThe War of Independence,\u201d the Mason and Dixon Line, and Gettysburg are dispersed throughout the work.",

These two works\u2014a technically refined casting of precious materials for a powerful monarch, and a group of movable wood figures celebrating a new democratic era\u2014commemorate specific important moments in the political histories of their respective societies. \n\r\nThe Edo figure glorifies the spirit of a deceased king, or oba, who ruled the kingdom of Benin at the height of its power. A motif on the figure's kilt depicting an elephant, whose trunk ends in a human right hand, identifies this work with the reign of the oba Esigie, who ruled from 1504 to 1550. \n\r\nJohannes Segogela's sculpture addresses the South African transition from the armed liberation struggle against whites-only apartheid rule into the new democratic era, born the following year with the multiracial elections that swept Nelson Mandela to power. The work suggests the need for South Africans to cast their weapons into the furnace.",

Produced in 1975, during her time as an art student at the State University of New York, Buffalo, the work prefigures her famous Untitled Film Stills series by two years. In it, the artist references Claude Cahun, an early Surrealist photographer whose androgynous self-portraits inspired a later generation of feminist theorists to think about gender as a social role that is performed rather than innate\u2014ideas that would become central to Sherman\u2019s oeuvre from the mid-1970s onward.",

In a maternal fashion, the spider weaves a perfect web that serves as a protective barrier and provides food. For Bourgeois, the spider also suggests the patience and industriousness that served her mother well as a skilled weaver in the family business of tapestry restoration. Thus, the image of the spider is capable of evoking both threat and tenderness; such a meeting of supposed opposites or a reconciliation of conflicting or even contradictory states is one of the most characteristic features of Louise Bourgeois\u2019s art.",
