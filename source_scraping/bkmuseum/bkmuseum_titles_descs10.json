In this mythological subject, he based the exuberantly contoured figures and complex, dance-like composition on the elongated figures and virtuoso compositions of sixteenth-century Italian Mannerism and its nineteenth-century French heir, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Working in Paris, Feitelson no doubt was aware that Pablo Picasso had already moved in this direction, creating beautifully outlined figures inspired by classical sculpture and Renaissance painting. Although this work\u2019s chalky, fresco-like colors also refer to Renaissance art, the figures are lithe, athletic, and unmistakably modern.",

Yakovlev trained at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts but traveled at a young age to Italy and Spain, where he applied the light and modeling of the Old Masters to modern subjects. Unable to return to Russia after the outbreak of the October Revolution, Yakovlev settled in Paris but continued to travel across the globe, immersing himself in world cultures.

The Hero is a forerunner of more than ten sculptures produced between 1952 and 1960 that Smith titled his Tanktotem series. \"Tank\" refers to the industrial tank lids or boiler tops he used to construct his pieces, while \"totem\" may indicate the influence of Sigmund Freud's book Totem and Taboo.",

This canvas, which shows traces of an earlier image through the thickly applied pigment, appears to be one of many that Bacon abandoned before completion. A 1982 letter from the artist to the Brooklyn Museum reveals that Bacon discarded the painting in 1956\u201357, considering it a failure. He gave it to an artist friend, who apparently did not follow through on his intention to obliterate the image and paint on the other side. Here, as in Bacon\u2019s many other unfinished canvases, the power of the artist\u2019s vision still makes itself felt.",

They prove that the Western tradition of naturalism\u2014 depicting the body precisely as observed in life\u2014is not even remotely the only possibility open to an artist. \n\r\nThe Mossi mask celebrates the female form. While it is not an exact replica of the body, the proportions are relatively balanced. The Yoruba tapper, used with a board to draw images during divinations, was carved with more exaggerated proportions, partly in order to contain it within the functional form of a tapper and the shape of the ivory from which it was carved. \n\r\nThe Fang figure, a masterpiece by a known artist or workshop, has primarily been reduced to a series of basic shapes\u2014cylinders and circles. The legs and hips are conceived as the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders, echoing the cylindrical reliquary box on which the figure sat. The small Nsapo-Nsapo work and the Chamba figure take the abstraction of the human form even further by greatly exaggerating the proportions. The Nsapo-Nsapo example's stretched arms and the Chamba sculpture's outsized hands suggest different emotional states for these two protective figures\u2014a tense anxiety, perhaps, in one and a lumbering aggression in the other.",

All were collected at the beginning of the twentieth century. The design is reportedly that of a Chambri drum captured by the Iatmul people and then used to celebrate their victory. This type of drum, which originally had a membrane covering the top, provides accompaniment for clan songs on ceremonial occasions such as funerals, the launching of new canoes, or the completion of a clan house.",

Zimmermann and Elizabeth Copeland, the maker of the nearby box, were among the few women metalsmiths to achieve national fame.",

Unable to return to Russia after the outbreak of the October Revolution, Yakovlev settled in Paris but continued to travel across the globe, immersing himself in world cultures.

While the vantage point implies a place for the viewer across from the seated woman, the austere jutting wedge of the white tablecloth and the placement of the basket of fruit set her apart. Moreover, with her head and shoulders bowed over her cup, the woman stirs her drink with meditative self-absorption. Bonnard further underscores the detachment of the figures with the turned back of the retreating child.",

The fiberglass shell of his chair is two-toned, with a sweeping void between the two sections, deliberately denying the unity to which other designers aspired. Nelson ran a large design firm, and many of the works attributed to his office were actually designed by employees. This chair was probably created by Charles Pollack.",

            "description": "Although one of the twentieth century's most prolific creators of handmade jewelry, William Spratling stood consciously outside the modernist movement thatt flourished during his career. Trained as an architect, he was introduced to the idea of jewelry making during sojourns in Mexico beginning in 1926. In 1929 he moved to Taxco, Mexico, the site of centuries-old silver mines, and set up a company of local artisans to revive the art of silver hollowware and jewelry. His designs were inspired primarily by pre-Columbian motifs. This venture became an enormous success, especially during World War II and immediately after when department stores in the United States were cut off from European suppliers of luxury goods. Unfortunately, Spratling lost control of his company to other investors, and by 1946 Spratling y Artesanos was out of business. Thanks to his apprenticeship system, however, his legacy continues in Mexico today.",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

According to Osage consultants, the headdress was used in ritual preparations for the hunt.\n\r\nThe Osage cosmos is composed of an invisible creative force, called Wakonta, that is ever-changing within an ordered cosmos constructed with four major, interwoven divisions: sky, earth, day, and night. The sky is associated with north, the left side, and the male gender. Earth is allied with the south, the right side, and the female gender. Day is linked to the east, the sun, life, birth, the male gender, and the color red. Night is connected to the west, the moon, destruction, the female gender, and the color black. Regalia worn by the Osage people often symbolically reflect the complex elements of their cosmos.\n\r\nThe kingfisher attached to the back of the headdress symbolically unites the Osage Sky and Earth people, since the bird flies in the sky and hunts in the water. The bird also unites the male (sky) and female (earth) forming the left and right side of the Osage universe. The northern harrier and red-tailed hawk feathers attached to the trailer are symbolic of the sun or life and give the hunter the power to move quickly and effectively.",

The conversion of King Ezana in 330 c.e. led to its official acceptance and the minting of coins bearing one of the earliest uses of the cross as a Christian symbol. Although the silver pendant crosses in the Museum\u2019s collection are from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, their forms have a considerably longer history, as the much older copper, wood, and iron crosses here demonstrate.\n\r\nHand crosses, which are used by priests, are either hand-held or suspended from a cord around the neck. They are kissed by the faithful to receive a blessing. Processional crosses are carried on long poles in religious processions. Prayer staffs are used to mark rhythms during sacred dances and as supports to lean on while standing for long hours during Orthodox church services. Together, all of these crosses are emblems of the Ethiopian Orthodox church\u2019s ongoing authority.",

Dove\u2019s last major canvas, serves as a poignant summation of his longtime quest for the \u201celimination of the non-essential.\u201d Basing the composition on the view of the pond from his Long Island home, he distilled the landscape into flat, hard-edged geometric shapes that approach pure abstraction. \n\r\nThough an intimate of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s circle of modern artists, Dove preferred to live and work outside the city in proximity to nature. Considered the first American artist to produce purely nonrepresentational pictures (in 1910), he used form and color to express his deep spiritual feelings about the natural world.",

            "description": "Samuel Yellin was one of the most important American metalworkers of the early twentieth century. He executed metalwork for the National Cathedral in Washington, D. C., and the New York Athletic Club and Temple Emanuel in New York. Unlike the other metal pieces exhibited here, this one was never installed in a building. Rather, it was a maquette (or study) and may have been the presentation piece shown to the architects of the Federal Reserve Bank in lower Manhattan (see illustration below) to help Yellin secure the commission. The final designs of the actual metalwork in the bank, which Yellin, in the Arts and Crafts tradition, executed by hand, are closely related. Yellin was not an architect as were the designers of the other metal pieces here; rather, the Renaissance Revival style of this grille was dictated by the bold Italian Renaissance style of the bank.",

When the hairbrush was made, the French Art Nouveau style was new and considered avant-garde. The dense, curvilinear floral design and the female head with long, curling tresses are characteristic of that style. A generation later, this taste for curvilinear naturalism was supplanted by the French Art Moderne (or Art Deco) style of the hand mirror. Here, nature is still invoked in the decoration, but it is rendered in a more schematic, hard-edged manner that appears more modern today.",

These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.\n\r\nThe two Bobo works share a basic form\u2014a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns\u2014typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.\n\r\nThe Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.",
