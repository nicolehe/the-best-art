Shot against an unfinished mural, in a public park, and on a playing field, the actors walk forward, backward, and in slow circles, with the world around them largely unaffected by their movement. \n\r\nJemison moves between letting the footage play naturally and reversing it, making it unclear if the action is unfolding in real time or not. Techniques of repetition and reversal confuse time, space, and sequence. These strategies provoke viewers to consider the impact of inherited narratives and question notions of linear progress, particularly in relation to black Americans.",

Materializing at water's edge against a soundtrack of tinkling bells and birdcalls, she squats before a multitiered chocolate cake and then messily devours it. Hunched over and swaying, she appears both primal and enchanted. \n\r\nThe woman's decadent clothing and voracious appetite invite reflection on our separation from the natural world and patterns of excessive consumption, while her ritualistic movements suggest an attempt to reconnect with both the earthly and spirit realms of the forest around her. Placed on the floor, Eat Cake forces us to bend over or even squat, mimicking the woman\u2019s position and, perhaps, also that of women in society at large.",

Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-\u00c0-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist\u2019s gilded \u201cTG\u201d monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.",

AfriCOBRA used what they called \u201ccoolade colors\u201d to create empowering images of African Americans\u2014which they deemed \u201cSuperreal images for Superreal people.\u201d Here a woman with an afro (then a highly political hairstyle) casts her gaze upward, as if envisioning a day when African Americans would be truly free.

The photograph at the lower center of the canvas shows a very young Julian Bond, then a leader of the civil rights organization Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The images of football players layered against the montage of black men marching and soldiering may also be a commentary on racial equality, since the artist created this collage at a moment when the National Football League, an organization slow to integrate, merged with the American Football League, which recruited from historically black colleges and universities.",

One evening, as I was painting in my car, a crowd of spectators began to gather along the levee across the road.

In the wake of the de-industrialization of the Brooklyn waterfront, artists moved into the decaying district in the 1970s in search of large studio space and cheap rents. Over the past fifteen years, developers converted many of the old buildings to luxury apartments and turned the waterfront into an attractive park.

Initially named Bright Passage or Hell Gate by Dutch explorers, the island and the river become a mythical place in Riley\u2019s densely rendered scenes. Influenced by tattoo art as well as woodcuts and nineteenth-century whaling art, this large-scale drawing invites the viewer to find hidden treasures and stories depicting tales of sexual exploits with pirates, mermaids and other mythical creatures. Part of Riley\u2019s vast multimedia project East River Incognita 1, The Bright Passage further evokes the ambiguous line between history and myth by including fragments and landmarks of contemporary life in New York.",

He often worked with simple geometric forms\u2014particularly the cube\u2014straight lines, and ninety-degree angles. Hanging Structure\u2019s suspended three-dimensional grid, composed of identical, monochromatic units, is emblematic of this interest. \n\r\nIn contrast, Terence Koh, inspired by queer, punk, and DIY cultures, belongs to a 1990s generation whose work is more personally inflected. Embracing decay and ephemerality, Untitled (Vitrines) displays whitewashed objects collected from friends, lovers, Koh\u2019s childhood, and flea markets, acting almost as a shrine preserving relics from his life. The sculpture departs significantly from LeWitt\u2019s strict vision yet engages with the legacies of Minimalism and Conceptual art, exploring the possibilities of the grid and the monochrome and extending those formal considerations into the personal realm.",

Many of them employ roughly finished marble blocks, with the exquisitely carved figurative elements seamlessly growing from the stone mass. Hands appear frequently among these pieces. As the most important tool of the artist, hands are celebrated in many forms. They are expressive of character and mood, and serve in the process of communication. The two finely carved hands in D\u00e9contract\u00e9e appear in a moving gesture that suggests the relaxation and release that might follow a painful experience.",

In his series Sleeping by the Mississippi, he depicts not only the people and places that make up life along the river, but also the shift in culture as the river flows from north to south. Soth presents these photographs as a fragmented narrative, a rambling sequence of images similar to the flow of dream imagery or the currents of the unconscious. With his interest in the representation of the United States and its inhabitants, his portraits express a wide range of feelings, from pride to loneliness and vulnerability.\n\r\nThis image shows a man bundled in workman\u2019s clothes against a bleak rural landscape; he presents model airplanes to the viewer, as if explaining a project. With its implicit references to the iconic American aviator Charles Lindbergh (whose unassuming boyhood bed is shown in another photograph in the group) and to the very idea of America (in the colors and emblematic stars and stripes on one of the planes), the image is both an intimate, personal portrait of a man and his toys and a link to the rest of the series.",

The iron, which left a singed impression in the middle panel, suggests domestic service (Cole\u2019s mother and grandmother both worked as housekeepers), but its form also recalls both the European ships that carried captive African laborers to the Americas and historical African masks.\n\r\nIn the first and third panels, Cole superimposes the iron-as-mask image over his own face. By connecting a suggestion of iron marks to his face in the first panel, Cole further evokes the manner in which history has marked his body. He suggests both ritual scarification patterns and the branding irons that turned the bodies of African laborers into Western commodities.",

Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-\u00c0-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist\u2019s gilded \u201cTG\u201d monogram.

His eyes, however, are hidden beneath a superimposed \u201ccurtain\u201d created from a reproduction of a battle scene illustrated in a Qajar period Persian lithographed book. The image seems to question the deterioration of traditional Iranian culture in the face of an increasingly superficial world driven by new media. \n\r\nTirafkan belongs to a group of contemporary Muslim artists whose work is increasingly sought by collectors and museums in the Middle East, Europe, and North America.

Working with discarded metal bottle caps collected from a liquor distillery, Anatsui modifies this unremarkable everyday material, chosen for both its physical qualities and its bodily connection to the original consumer, to make vast, undulating sheets. \n\r\nAnatsui\u2019s sheets are pieced together and hung without prescribed orientation, taking on new shapes with each installation. This \u201cnon-fixed form,\u201d as the artist calls it, is emblematic of Anatsui\u2019s desire for his work to remain dynamic, inspiring creativity in those who install it and illustrating the ever-changing conditions of life.\n\r\nIn Black Block, Anatsui uses only one color (though the black is broken up by flashes of red and yellow) and only one type of metal piece across a monumental expanse of some 15,000 elements.",

Born and raised on the Navajo reservation, she lived with her grandmother and was surrounded by Navajo stories and cultural traditions. For Whitehorse, the Southwest landscape is her identity and the source of her inspiration. In this painting, loosely formed abstractions fill the surface and float in a hazy, fluid medium that could be a mirage of heat or a sandstone cliff. The floating, abstract shapes resemble seeds, pods, and roots of plants, imagery that also relates to Navajo weaving, in which plants are used as dye sources. As a child, Whitehorse collected plants with her grandmother, who hung them on the walls of their house to dry. That is the origin of the floating vegetal forms.",
