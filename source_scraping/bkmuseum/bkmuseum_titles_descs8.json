He depicted the dignity in everyday life, showing people poised at a bus stop, paused before a traffic intersection, or conversing on a park bench. Segal's work also took on political themes such as the Holocaust and gay pride. At the time this sculpture was created, the artist discussed its art historical references: \"The chair is like a ladder with steps, the box is like a house, the girl is like a Greek caryatid holding up the roof . . . I've always liked the hardness and softness combined, this wedding of organic and geometric.\"",

Undertaking the series in response to the shock of 9/11, Serrano set out to answer the question of who we are and what the diversity of America actually looks like. He captures the humanity of his subjects while at the same time the scale of the figures, as they are positioned within the picture frame, gives them almost heroic proportions.",

            "description": "Shown in 1972 at the De Luxe Black Arts Center in Houston, one of the first U.S. exhibition spaces to place the work of artists of color alongside that of their white peers, Power Flight takes an experimental approach to painting, moving it off the wall and into three-dimensional space. Freed from the confines of a stretcher, the canvas, composed of five connected triangles, is pulled taut by ropes. The resulting shape suggests nomadic shelters, easily assembled and disassembled by individuals fleeing harm. Using the colors of the Pan-African flag, Joe Overstreet connects metaphors of flight and nomadism to transnational struggles for black liberation.\n\r\nCommitted to both experimental art-making and socio-political engagement, the artist notes that his life and work have been \"tied up in abstract shape with what black [people] have felt and struggled.\" In 1973 he and his wife founded Kenkeleba House, a New York gallery focused on artists underrepresented by mainstream institutions.",

Yet, with his expressionistic painting of massive granite cliffs and dramatically lit storm clouds, Wang achieves a new portrayal of the venerable landscape theme.",

During a period of crime and political and financial instability, artists such as Butler considered the site\u2019s uncertain fate as a subject for their work. Saturated colors glide through these playful images, taken while Butler was physically in motion, emulating the vision of a visitor in flux on an amusement park ride. \n\r\nThe figures in these two photographs stride forward boldly in contemporary attire: sundresses and straw hats, and leather vests with tattooed arms. The vibrant energy and sense of movement and chaos reject sentimentality, alluding to the velocity of time. Butler is interested in conveying the rush of disorder and the change from past to present Coney Island, and aims to signal the need for historic preservation in its future.",

This park carried on the Coney tradition during the following decades. In 1983, the not-for-profit corporation Coney Island USA was created to assist in rejuvenating Coney Island\u2019s amusement life. It developed many of the programs that later generations of visitors recognize, such as the Mermaid Parade, Sideshows by the Seashore, and concerts on the boardwalk.

Inspired by myths, fairytales, dreams, and childhood fantasies, Goicolea\u2019s image, part of a series called Sheltered Life, is a mysterious landscape partly constructed by the artist with the help of digital technology. Like the other images from this series, Ice Storm focuses on alternative living spaces in environments that often dwarf the inhabitants. The remains of an animal carcass, leftovers of an enigmatic, primeval scene, lie at the foot of the tree in the foreground, while brown bags of unknown content can be seen in several places. The beauty of icicles and ice-covered twigs, but also the dangers amid the rocky outcrops and ravines in these unforgiving and overwhelming surroundings, pose questions about this particular living arrangement.",
