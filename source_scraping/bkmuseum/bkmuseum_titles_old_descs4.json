In 1922, however, he returned to the Synchromistic aesthetic, which he found emotionally and creatively invigorating. Abstraction bears a strong formal relation to a series of paintings he called Eidos, a term taken from the Greek word meaning \"form.\"  The illusion of spinning motion relates to Russell's plan to accompany his paintings with a kinetic light machine that would suggest the afterimage of fireworks. The signature along the horizontal is not in Russell's hand, and it is generally agreed that the painting should be oriented vertically.",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

At this point the exclusive Seagate had long since separated from the main part of Coney, while the eastern end had gone out of fashion, with the last remaining resorts quickly disappearing. The Oriental Hotel closed in 1916, and Brighton Beach Hotel was razed a few years later. In the 1920s, many Eastern European Jews and Italian and Greek immigrants took up residence in the neighborhood adjoining the amusement district. Dreamland was long gone, and Luna somewhat declining, but Steeplechase was still a popular destination.

He addressed the effects of World War I, at least symbolically, with its title, which references the mounting casualties of the war. Inspired in part by the seminal modern dancer Isadora Duncan, Davies had often composed figure compositions suggestive of sequential movement and, therefore, of elapsed time and music. Here, the more rigid dramatic postures of the figures may have been modeled on the theatrical modern choreography of Ruth St. Denis.",

One of the only examples of Yoruba sculptural art that is deliberately unattractive, it features a sharp brow, protruding eyes, and wide mouth\u2014all designed to frighten.\n\r\nThe commanding Loma mask, Okobuzogui, is used by the Poro society, a secret men\u2019s association that serves, among other roles, to initiate boys into adulthood. Poro mythology holds that Okobuzogui \u201cswallows\u201d the boys in his menacing jaws as they leave the village for the initiation camp; he also accompanies them upon their return as young men.\n\nTugunga headdresses are worn only by those who belong to a secret Bamum society of warriors, known as the Nsoro, who perform at the funerals of important members of the community.

The butterfly symbolizes man\u2019s spiritual transformation. Mark Tahbo, an accomplished potter and Chapella\u2019s great grandson, interprets the jar\u2019s designs as symbolic of water\u2019s life-giving cycle: the butterflies indicate a burst of life after the spring rains; the wave patterns dotted with cross forms are cornfields surrounded by water; the jagged peaks are the three Hopi mesas in northern Arizona; and the black fingerlike forms are prayer feathers used in rain ceremonies. \n\n\r\nLos dise\u00f1os de Grace Chapella est\u00e1n inspirados en vasijas arqueol\u00f3gicas del antiguo sitio Hopi de Sityakti, el cual data del siglo catorce al siglo quince.

In Street Scene 2, there is a clear assertiveness about the standing woman, with her left arm holding a stack of newspapers and her right hand on her hip. In Lady and Lamp, the subject\u2019s reclining posture and distanced gaze are juxtaposed with her formal attire, suggesting the need to unwind after a long day of work. \n\r\nLike other New York City neighborhoods at the time, Harlem was still recovering from poverty, overcrowding, and other devastating symptoms of the Great Depression. Details in these photographs, such as the ripped fabric on the arms of the chair and the \u201cFurnished Room\u201d si, hint gently at the harsh conditions that these modern urban women were up against.",

John Biggers described its subject as \u201cthe interdependence of living organisms in the balance of nature, and the relationship of all organisms to one another through the long line of evolutionary descent.\u201d \n\r\nBiggers centered the image on an essential earth mother. Throughout, he paired oppositional references to life and death (winter and summer), male and female (the two nudes), and Africa and America (in vignettes of harvest and sowing). A leading twentieth-century African American painter and muralist, Biggers drew inspiration from the Mexican Mural Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s. He also infused the composition with the kind of organic, cellular design that was so current in midcentury American art.",

Vincent Cianni\u2019s 1995 image captures a graceful moment of a teenage boy midair. \n\r\nThe backgrounds of these images reveal changing textures of the neighborhood landscapes: felt hats with fur trim and arched glass storefront windows in the former, and baggy T-shirts and graffiti scrawled along a block in the latter. Although taken forty-five years apart, these photographs display skating as a communal and enjoyed act for Brooklyn youth.",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea\u2019a\u2019ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).",

The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchit\u00e1n of the Women (1979\u201386). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchit\u00e1n, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.\n\r\nLike her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist\u2019s own word, \u201ccomplicity.\u201d",

Technically, cloisonn\u00e9 employs the diverse skills of painting, engraving, metalworking, casting, and firing. To create designs on metal vessels, enclosures made of bronze or copper called cloisons (French for \u201cpartitions\u201d) are bent to the desired pattern and either pasted or soldered onto the body. Enamels are essentially glass, colored with metal oxides, that is ground to a powder, mixed with water, and placed as a paste inside the cloisons. The vessel is then fired at a low heat between 1280 and 1328 degrees Fahrenheit. During firing, the enamel may shrink; after cooling, the process is repeated and re-fired until the cells are completely filled with fused enamel.",

The juxtaposition of natural fibrers with the luminous new synthetic material was wholly original at the time. A nearly identical hanging by Hallman was included in the seminal 1969 exhibition Objects USA, which introduced Americans to variety of new designs of the emerging craft movement and helped to bridge the perceived aesthetic gap between so-called craft \r\nand fine arts.",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design.

His career culminated with the commission for a large-scale outdoor sculpture for the Mall in Washington, D.C. As with Alexander Calder, the most famous Aamerican abstract sculptor of the last century, de Rivera seems to have made jewelry for most of career but never actively retailed it. This abstract, biomorphic brooch is made of stainless steel, his preferred material for his sculpture but a relatively unusual choice for American jewelry in the mid-twentieth century. The historical importance of the brooch is heightened by rare documentation. In 1947, de Rivera made two brooches for his sister-in-law Elva Ruiz, who was married to his half brother Gordon, and his niece Muriel. Iin a letter to Elva, de Rivera terms the pieces \u201csculpture brooches\u201d and adds that \u201cI hope that you will like the shapes and wear them\u2014also that they will give you some pleasure.\u201d",

Because she was generations older than the avant-garde artists she was drawn to, and being largely self-taught, Wilson acquired the nickname \u201cGrandma Moses of the Underground.\u201d In her Ridiculous Portraits, Wilson collaged ludicrous photo-booth self-portraits onto images she collected from picture postcards, reproductions of famous paintings, mainstream magazines, and soft-core pornography. Produced as personal mementos and often exchanged through the mail with other artists as gifts, her Ridiculous Portraits attacked sexism, ageism, and the cult of beauty with a wry sense of absurdity.",

By contrast, the painter creates a hint of sky by daubing a thick, lightly blended mix of blue and white over the branches and foliage.

The shadowy profile of a woman's head that helps to define the musician's torso and merges with the cello may rely on a traditional iconography in which the curved shapes of the instrument were metaphors for the female form.",

            "description": "Manuel Alvarez Bravo grew up during the Mexican Revolution (1910\u221220), a formative period that strengthened his sense of kinship with his homeland. During this time he was introduced to the medium of photography, and he bought his first camera in 1924. Initially working in the Pictorialist tradition, Alvarez Bravo started to experiment with abstract compositions in the late 1920s. In 1927 he befriended the Italian photographer Tina Modotti, who had been living and working in Mexico since 1923, and he later took over her job as a staff photographer at the magazine Mexican Folkways. This post helped him cultivate his own vision, as he developed emblematic themes of Mexican identity blended with unconscious imagery reflecting dreams and chance. \n\r\nIn this photograph, Alvarez Bravo uses the everyday to create a compelling vision of Mexico\u2019s urban landscape. The horizontal expanse of wall centers the layered composition, separating the world above from the one below. Two figures, seemingly unaware of each other, pass on the empty street, while stark white laundry hangs in the domestic space above, its brightness creating a link to the woman\u2019s package below. Despite the solidity of the wall, the passersby and flowing fabric suggest the ephemerality of this fleeting moment.",

He exercised careful control in forming the regularized volumes and polished surface, and added a touch of delicacy with the gilt detailing on the costume and hair. Vivian St. George was the only child of the Irish painter Sir William Orpen and the married American heiress Evelyn St. George. Manship received the portrait commission through his friend the American painter John Singer Sargent, with whom he lived briefly in London in the early 1920s.",

            "description": "When the American photographer Berenice Abbott returned to New York in 1929 after nearly a decade in France, she found a city transformed by modern life. After the Works Progress Administration was established a few years later, she was hired to document the city, producing a large number of often dramatically composed images reflecting its changing features. In this image, Abbott photographed the Trinity and U.S. Realty Buildings (1904\u221207) on Broadway and Thames Street in the southern part of Manhattan. Older buildings and warehouses sit in the shadow of twentieth-century office towers. Abbott\u2019s steep perspective emphasizes the contrasts in scale and the break between old and new.",

All of the artist\u2019s works included here feature this approach, which imbues her subjects with an anonymous, everyman character. Subjects like Ben Casey, the doctor-hero of a melodramatic 1960s television series, become flat representations of cultural stereotypes; for Weber, the literal flatness of the figures is analogous to the superficial renderings of pop culture characters. In other examples, Weber depicts the quotidian\u2014people on an escalator or skipping rope\u2014with a cold precision. In Munchkins I, II & III, Weber portrays nondescript businessmen in New York\u2019s PanAm (now MetLife) building, one of the world\u2019s largest office buildings at the time, in the middle of the drudgery of their daily commute.",

            "description": "Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion\u2019s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",
