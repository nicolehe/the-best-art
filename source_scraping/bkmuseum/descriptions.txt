Kate Gilmore sets up scenarios in which she performs tasks that test her physical endurance, such as breaking out of confining spaces, scaling high walls, or moving heavy objects. These feats are at once potentially dangerous and seemingly meaningless, yet the artist enacts them repeatedly with unwavering determination and focus. Gilmore originally executed and recorded Blood from a Stone in the Museum’s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art before the work appeared in the 2009–10 exhibition Reflections on the Electric Mirror: New Feminist Video.
 This image shows the rooms that were the elegant Detroit executive offices of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, in the 1910s and 1920s. The wood paneling has lost its luster, and a lush carpet of brilliant green moss now covers the floor. The decrepit state of Ford’s office—a contemporary ruin of a glorious, not too distant past—becomes a metaphor not only for the fate of the automobile industry or of this once wealthy and important Midwestern city, but also for the deindustrialization of America.
 ART OF TRAUMABoth of these very different Congolese works are deeply emotional expressions. One was commissioned to resolve a personal trauma, while the other represents a viscerally remembered social upheaval from the colonial era. Figures like this mother and child were believed to offer protection, through the intervention of spirits, by the Bwanga Bwa Cibola society. When a woman lost successive children through miscarriages or early infant death, she could be initiated into the society to protect herself from ominous forces suspected to be the cause of the deaths. This emotionally gripping figure is considered to be one of the great masterpieces of African art. Tshibumba's painting depicts the slaughter of striking mineworkers in Lubumbashi at the order of the Belgian colonial government on December 9, 1941. The artist critiques the institutions complicit in the colonial system: Belgium (represented by the flag), the church, the mining company, the colonial governor (with arm raised), and the Congolese soldiers in the colonial army. Following independence in 1960, a market for narrative painting developed among urban Congolese who were working in mining factories and living in new, Western-style homes.
 Since the 1960s Philip Pearlstein has been making paintings of human bodies posed in interior spaces. The bodies are arranged casually, usually cropped (often at the head), and the harsh, cool light reveals the surfaces and hollows of the flesh. This intense realism recalls the view through a photographic lens.
 Through her photographs, Cass Bird asserts the positive existence of people who push the perceived boundaries of gender. In this way she suggests a world that is Whitmanesque in rejecting society’s restrictions. In this photograph, taken on a rooftop in Brooklyn, Bird’s friend Macaulay stares out from under a cap emblazoned with the words “I Look Just Like My Daddy.” Macaulay’s gender is ambiguous. Her cap’s proclamation is likewise ambiguous—perhaps it is true, or perhaps it is an ironic statement of an expectation that will never be realized.
 The street artist Swoon’s ethereal installation juxtaposes five portraits with the Cyclone, one of the last existing wooden roller coasters. As if it were seen in their dreams, the Cyclone’s lace-like structure acquires a gossamer quality. Given Swoon’s fascination with Coney Island’s ceaseless potential for magic and mystery, her three-dimensional dreamscape may represent a cautiously optimistic belief in the site’s continual rebirth.
 Throughout her long and prolific career Niki de Saint Phalle, a former cover model for Life magazine and French Vogue, investigated feminine archetypes and women’s societal roles. Her Nanas, bold, sexy sculptures of the proverbial everywoman, are playful and empowering, while the whimsical lithographs My Love We Won’t and Dear Diana offer humorous takes on girlhood obsessions. The savvy My Heart Belongs to Marcel pays homage not to Daddy (as in the popular song), but to Marcel Duchamp, the influential Dada artist and a personal friend.

 The Empty City: Fragrant Creek is from a series that comments on the fate of the cities, towns, and villages along the Yangtze River that were evacuated ahead of the flooding expected from the Three Gorges Dam in China. The main subject here is the river itself, meandering through the entire image. On its banks, caught amid tangled vegetation, are the remains of former human habitation; we are witnessing the brutal results of forced displacement. Eventually, the coming flood will submerge this scene.Despite the highly contemporary references, the artist has chosen to use traditional Chinese techniques and visual symbolism. He uses layered mulberry paper, applying ink, watercolor, and mineral pigments, and often distresses the paper by overworking it.
 Hairstyles are often complex signifiers of identity and social status, particularly for the Yoruba people. They can indicate a woman’s age, her occupation, and, in some contexts, her religious or political power. Many hairdos are also tied to specific ceremonies, such as a wedding or the naming ceremony of a child. Working over three decades, J. D. ’Okhai Ojeikere undertook a photographic series systematically documenting the rich variety of Nigerian hairstyles. He sought to capture the diversity and beauty of the hairdos he witnessed in the streets of cities and villages, in marketplaces and offices, and at parties, celebrations, and festivals around the country. Most of the photographs, like Fro Fro and Suku Sinero Kiko, were taken from behind, revealing and emphasizing the abstract and sculptural aspects of the hairdos.

 In a thirty-year photographic project, Ojeikere sought to systematically document the rich variety and beauty of the contemporary Nigerian hairstyles he witnessed in daily life. Most of the photographs, like Abebe, were taken from behind, revealing the abstract and sculptural aspects of the hairdos.Hairstyles are often complex signifiers of identity and social status, particularly for the Yoruba. They can indicate a woman’s age, her occupation, her religious or political power, or even her state of mind. Many hairdos are also tied to specific ceremonies, such as a wedding or the naming ceremony of a child. The abebe (fan) style shown here has an implication of “coolness,” composure, and royalty, qualities that are ideally linked.
 In her Waterfall series, Pat Steir has explored the imagery of water, continuing her fascination with landscape. This work, which verges on abstraction, is nevertheless an evocative representation of a waterfall. The artist applied a number of horizontal brushstrokes loaded with thinned paint at the top of the canvas, and the paint streamed down in lines, drips, and rivulets, emulating the properties of water.
 When I'm doing my pottery I think of Mom [Marie Z. Chino] first, and that she could help me. I want to do like she does. She didn't need outlining, she just painted, and sometimes I do that now I know the design and I just do it.-Grace Chino, quoted in Rick Dillingham, Fourteen Families in Pueblo Pottery (1994)The Chino family, led by the matriarch Marie Z. Chino, was innovative in adapting the designs found on prehistoric pottery shards to modern pottery forms. Grace Chino here used a dazzling, closely lined black-and-white design on a new vessel form reminiscent of ancient Pueblo pots. The result is a form of abstraction that embraces tradition as essential to innovation.
 Melvin Edwards’s weighty sculptures combine nails, tools, gears, and other metal objects to create abstract compositions. This work belongs to his extensive Lynch Fragment series, begun in the 1960s and inspired by Ralph Ginzburg’s 100 Years of Lynching (1962), a collection of newspaper reports of lynchings published to commemorate the centennial of the Civil War. The Lynch Fragment sculptures evoke this history of violence through their jarring juxtaposition of forms and rough welding. Takawira–J, a later work from the series, was made while Edwards was teaching in Zimbabwe and was named for John Takawira, a sculptor he met there.
 My grandmother braided my hair as she did when I was a child, with pigtails, barrettes, and ribbons. It was her way of adorning me as her champion porcelain doll. This image captures a rare moment where she wanted to make a portrait of me with her and her dolls. I set up one light and ran a cable release behind my back. There was nobody present but Grandma Ruby and me. We both quietly sat up and looked over our shoulders into the lens. I pressed the cable release, and the shutter clicked for nearly one second. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Valerie Hegarty’s Fallen Bierstadt is inspired by the work of the renowned nineteenth-century American landscape painter Albert Bierstadt (whose monumental A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie hangs to the right). Hegarty was drawn to the way nineteenth-century landscape artists depicted vast expanses of wilderness as an expression of “Manifest Destiny,” the notion that the United States was divinely entitled to expand across the entire North American continent. In Fallen Bierstadt the “canvas” appears to decay, as if affected by the ravages of nature. The title seems to refer both to the physical appearance of the piece and to the end of a heroic tradition of landscape painting.
 Liu Dan received his early education from his grandfather. Following the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), he entered the Jiangsu Chinese Painting Institute to gain formal training. Meticulous brushwork and subtle gradations in ink tones are hallmarks of his painting style.This monumental painting depicts a Taihu rock, or spirit stone, a variety of limestone appreciated by Chinese connoisseurs for the way it suggests a landscape in miniature. The rock's combination of abstract forms and voided space also recalls Chinese calligraphy. These stones were often installed in gardens or on the desks of scholars as focal points for meditation. In the hands of a contemporary artist, the traditional Taihu rock form becomes a modernist abstraction.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 John I. H. Baur, head of the Brooklyn Museum’s Department of Painting and Sculpture from 1936 to 1952, here appears seated in an interior space, perhaps his office. His body, cropped at the head and ankle, fills the frame. Alice Neel captured idiosyncrasies such as his lightly rumpled suit, wrinkled face, and veiny hands. One of her guiding principles as a portraitist was, in her words, that “every person is a new universe unique with its own laws.”
 Unlike the majority of American painters who were engaged with gestural abstraction at mid-century, Hale Woodruff remained rooted in an artistic process that originated with traditional notions of subject matter. A leading African American artist of the period, Woodruff had devoted his energies emphatically to subjects relevant to the black experience and the civil rights effort beginning in the 1930s. After his move to New York in 1946 and a decisive turn to abstraction, he executed numerous landscapes such as this one, in which the forms are intended to convey the character of a particular place and time of day.
 Gowanus Canal from 2nd Street is a meticulously executed image of an old Brooklyn industrial waterway. Amid the abundant vegetation, figures equipped with long poles search for something in the murky water. The large warehouse in the middle of this carefully balance composition seems to be abandoned. Car tires, wrecked buses, and cars on the right slowly change into the jagged outline of a cityscape in the background. The canal's still waters are embellished by the reflections of its environs. There is an inherent beauty in this melancholic scene. We begin to understand the attraction this human-made waterway has for Brooklyn residents. At present, the cleanup of the Gowanus Canal and plans for its recreational use are under way.
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.

 Elsa Rady’s porcelain vessels merge Asian ceramic tradition with the simplicity of modern European and American design. In the course of her career, Rady began to focus on the sculptural aspects of her work rather than the utilitarian features usually associated with the vessel form. In 1990 she began to assemble her pieces in groups of various sizes. The works of her Still Life series are tableaux in which the individual pieces relate to each other very much as objects in traditional still-life paintings do. In Still Life IV two distinctly different vessels are paired on an aluminum shelf that is attached to a rectangular backdrop, which suggests the clearly defined pictorial plane of a painting.
 Growing up on the urban terrain of concrete sidewalks, Brooklyn children and teenagers have long embraced skating as a pastime. In 1950 N. Jay Jaffee photographed a young skater as she extended her arm out to gain balance independent of her father’s hold. Vincent Cianni’s 1995 image captures a graceful moment of a teenage boy midair. The backgrounds of these images reveal changing textures of the neighborhood landscapes: felt hats with fur trim and arched glass storefront windows in the former, and baggy T-shirts and graffiti scrawled along a block in the latter. Although taken forty-five years apart, these photographs display skating as a communal and enjoyed act for Brooklyn youth.
 Originally built for the 1939 New York World’s Fair, the Parachute Jump has been a Coney Island landmark since 1941. Stephen Salmieri photographed the structure seven years after the ride ceased operating, when urban decline resulted in a vastly changed landscape.
 
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”

 Pretend #2 is constructed from three images of women with their young children. As in most of her work, both as a philosopher and as an artist, Adrian Piper addresses the social and economic imbalance of our world and the issue of racism. In the central image a Caucasian mother smiles proudly, looking straight into the camera. She seems unaware of the anguish of the African mother at the left or the Asian mother at the right. The silkscreened text across the bottom, “Pretend not to know what you know,” connects the three images and forces the viewer to contemplate the frequent denials we choose to make to lessen the pangs of conscience.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 Japanese pottery has always been closely associated with the tea ceremony. From ancient times the great Japanese tea masters used ceramic utensils to reflect their own ideas and style. One example is Oribe ware, named for the tea master Furuta Oribe (1544â1615). Oribe ceramics are distinguished by warped forms and bold pictorial patternsâa departure from earlier symmetrical designs. The Oribe tradition continues to the present, as indicated by the work of Takiguchi Kiheiji shown here.
 Blinds relates to Mary Heilmann’s so-called Jealousy Paintings, a series of abstract works initiated in the 1970s that was inspired by details of the artist’s immediate surroundings, such as air vents, French doors, and window blinds. The name of the series is a play on jalousie, a colloquial French word for window louvers or blinds, and a nod to the novel La Jalousie, by one of the artist’s favorite authors, Alain Robbe-Grillet. Blinds playfully questions the Renaissance concept of paintings as windows that offer a glimpse of other worlds, contiguous with ours. With its edges brushed gold to simulate a picture frame or, even, a window frame, Blinds nevertheless asserts its identity as a planar object.
 May Stevens has been a committed political activist throughout her long career. Her Big Daddy series began in response to her disappointment and anger over the Vietnam War. For Stevens, Big Daddy takes on aspects of both the personal and the political. Based on a portrait of her resolutely patriotic father, the obviously male figure is also reminiscent of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919). Here, the figure’s bullet-shaped head exaggerates his phallic power and capacity for violence. However, by depicting him as a paper doll, to be dressed up as an executioner, decorated soldier, policeman, or butcher, Stevens ultimately strips Big Daddy of his patriarchal command.
 Fernando Mastrangelo appropriates one of Mexico’s national symbols, the Aztec Calendar Stone, which dates from about 1500 and symbolizes the creation of the Aztec universe. Retaining the central skeletal face of Tonatiuh, the Sun God, Mastrangelo fills the surrounding areas with contemporary consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, candy, sparkplugs, and toothpaste.The depiction of corn-based products draws attention to Mexico’s mass cultivation of corn to meet energy needs (via ethanol) and foreign consumer demands. At the same time, an iconic Aztec image suggests parallels between the conquest of Mexico by the Spanish, centuries ago, and the present-day exploitation of local Mexican corn production by North American agribusiness.
 In Blossom, a piano inexplicably fused with a tree plays "Strange Fruit" (in an arrangement by the artist). The song, popularized in the 1930s by Billie Holiday, protests the atrocity of lynching: "Southern trees bear a strange fruit, / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root, / Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze, / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees." The haunting lyrics suggest that the fused piano may be read as a surrogate for a violated human body.Influenced by a 2006 incident in Jena, Louisiana, in which nooses were dangled from a tree at a racially troubled high school, the piece also evokes the rich cross-cultural symbolism of trees: Biggers alludes to the story of Buddha finding enlightenment under a bodhi tree. This unlikely combination demonstrates his interest in multiplicities of both inspiration and interpretation.
 Born features a theme that has prevailed in Kiki Smith’s work for years—the relationship between animals, particularly wolves, and humans. This image subverts the story line of one of the world’s best-known fairy tales by imagining Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother as born of the wolf rather than eaten by him.
 
 Betty Woodman is one of the preeminent ceramic artists working today. In her pieces she combines traditional techniques and materials with her own innovations, constantly crossing the boundaries between fine arts and crafts to extend the possibilities of ceramics. Still-Life Vase #10, from a series begun in 1990, displays the boldness of this artist’s approach. A fully developed large vase is the core of the piece, but its form gets almost obliterated by the dramatically painted surface. Large protruding wings, or handles, attached at the sides are themselves shaped as incomplete, flat vessels adorned with handles and other protrusions. Thus, the piece presents an arrangement of objects in space, a fundamental feature of the still-life genre in visual art.
 Polly Apfelbaum’s The Dwarves without Snow White demonstrates the artist’s interest in expanding the accustomed boundaries of painting. Apfelbaum paints with dyes on rectangles of crushed velvet that are then folded, showing the underlying layers of colors, and placed on cardboard boxes. The boxes function as pedestals for the painted velvet, integrating painting and sculpture in a single work. According to Apfelbaum, the box is a metaphor for the artist’s paint box as well as for the painted wedding chest, which historically held the trousseau that defined a woman’s standing in society. The title refers to the well-known fairy tale and its ideals of femininity.
 In the ongoing series Sunday Paintings, Byron Kim inscribes personal notes about his daily life onto his painted images of the sky. In nuanced hues of blue, each of the six examples shown here represents the sky on the Sunday it was painted. The words sit on the picture plane, creating a play between the painting as a flat surface and as a window opening onto the illusion of deep space. Lined up on a wall, the Sunday Paintings have a cinematic quality: each panel looks like a frame in a film sequence—a moment in time stilled—as if each is a part of a larger ongoing whole. While the works were created on Sundays, the title of this series also refers to amateurs known as “Sunday painters,” admired by Kim for the purity of their motives in making art.
 In his painting, Mark Bradford, a Los Angeles-based artist, incorporates the materials of his other profession, as a hair stylist, into his paintings. Blending the tools of the African American beauty trade with the more traditional medium of paint on canvas, Bradford crafts works that comment on both aesthetic and cultural phenomena. Pairing a "high art" medium with objects from daily life enables the artist to create subtle works that demonstrate his passion for issues of race, class, gender, and art-world politics.

 Corot builds the gently sloping silhouette of the mountain range with thin, transparent films of brown, gray, and blue paint in broad, visible brushstrokes. For the sky, he matches thick layers of blue, gray, and white pigment with expanses of paper prepared with a light base or ground coat of paint. Corot endows the stand of firs in the foreground with an unexpected calligraphic flatness and reduces the tree trunks to stems. His passion for painting out-of-doors in front of the subject—notably on three visits to Italy and several trips around France—earned him the reverence of subsequent generations of landscape painters, particularly the Impressionists.
 Here, Stephen Salmieri focuses on a balloon-toss worker at Coney Island whose down-turned teased hairstyle resembles the inflated balloons in the background. By isolating the subject and cropping out the surrounding amusement park activity, he establishes a sense of intimacy, as though the viewer could be next in line to play the game.
 Teri Greeves created this piece by hand-sewing beads, Swarovski crystals, silver conchos, and spiny-oyster shell cabochons on a pair of high-heeled tennis shoes designed by Steve Madden. The inner panels are inspired by Great Lakes tribes’ floral designs. The outside panels depict contemporary jingle dress dancers swaying to the drumming during a powwow. Each woman depicted on the shoes wears full regalia, including a beaded dress, moccasins, and a belt with real silver conchos. Greeves’s detailed beadwork melds traditional technique with modern fashion in a lively contemporary tour de force.
 Regional Work #2 is from a series of diptychs called Regional Pieces done by the artist in 1976. Here one panel depicts a seascape of dark purples, and the other a fish immersed in the same purple waters. Each panel is framed by drapery made of brightly painted Celastic, a clothlike material, giving the impression of viewing the image through a window (one above the sea line and the other below, looking directly into the ocean). Writing about her work, Morton referred to “the responsibility of the artist . . . to be free, and while in that freedom, to look, and to see while looking, and to feel, and to respond while feeling, and to be romantic, and to love the romance.”
 ART OF CREATIONWhile these works appear quite different on the surface, both are made from the same material, terracotta. They were also created through very similar techniques, in which the artist built up the form from thin coils of clay to produce a hollow vessel that could be further sculpted and fired. The head from the Nok culture is an archaeological fragment, possibly once part of a full figure. One of the oldest pieces in the African collection, it was found at one of the earliest known iron-smelting sites in Africa. Magdalene Odundo, a contemporary artist drawing on the global history of pottery, used an understated anthropomorphic vocabulary to create this abstract, burnished vessel that evokes the female form. Odundo achieved the black, smoky finish by covering her pots with a clay slip and firing them in a closed kiln with combustible materials such as wood chips. Since pottery has long been associated with women’s work across the African continent, some scholars have speculated that female artists created the ancient Nok statuary. It is thus possible that the two works displayed here—among the African collection's oldest and newest, respectively—may both be by women artists.
 Part of a series that features lengths of decommissioned fire hoses, In Case of Race Riot II exemplifies Theaster Gates’s practice of civic responsibility and social engagement. The work alludes to the Civil Rights Movement and, in particular, the use of high-pressure water hoses on peaceful African American demonstrators in Birmingham, Alabama, in May 1963. However, the possibility of future use of the fire hose, as suggested by the title, questions an easy acceptance of this tumultuous era of American history and points to the ongoing struggles for African Americans’ civil rights.
 Thomas E. Warren’s “Centripetal Spring” chair is the forerunner of Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf’s Aeron chair, designed nearly 150 years later. Both are made principally of metal, raised on casters for mobility, rotate on a central column, and allow for adjustment of the angle of the seat. The very different look of the chairs suggests the ways that consumer attitudes toward industrial invention and modernity have evolved over the centuries. Although Warren’s chair bears a patent mark (on the bottom of the seat), he felt the need to mitigate the newness of his invention by concealing its ingenious metal spring system beneath a dense, soft curtain of luxurious passementerie (elaborate trim). Similarly, he disguised his progressive use of cast iron for the frame by rendering it in the backward-looking Rococo Revival style and gilding it. In contrast, the makers of the Aeron chair reveal its mechanical elements, celebrate its recycled man-made materials, and use a monochromatic black to underline the seriousness of the design, all without fear of losing customers.
 
 Harry Lapow began frequenting Coney Island to capture quirks of the beach and boardwalk after receiving a Ciroflex camera on his forty-third birthday. He was intrigued by the camera’s ability to isolate details and fleeting moments of everyday life. Here, a toddler’s crossed legs appear above the head of a buried woman whose eyes are covered by a floral towel. In cropping this beach sighting, Lapow crafts a surprising juxtaposition, forming an unlikely dynamic between the lively child and the masked adult.
 In 1967, Richard Diebenkorn began a series of paintings named Ocean Park after the section of Santa Monica, California, where he had his studio. In contrast to his preceding, figurative group of works, this new series of abstract images allowed the artist to employ, as he put it, "an allover light which wasn't possible in the representational works, which seem somewhat dingy by comparison." In Ocean Park No.27, Diebenkorn reduces the scene to planes and fragments of color. Depth and spatial illusion are suggested by the color's changing density and the composition's system of receding lines. Using a low-key palette devoid of harsh tones, the artist accomplishes his stated goal of communicating "a feeling of strength in reserve, tension beneath calm."
 This powerful commentary on the history of war and race in America is from a series of nine mixed-media collages that the artist Joyce Kozloff calls “a kind of personal, quirky history of America.” The current invasion of Iraq was the emotional catalyst for this work, which portrays a trail of geopolitical conflicts. This piece, the fifth in the series, is composed of appropriated imagery, including musical notes and song lyrics taken from 1920s game boards given to the artist by her mother. It depicts laboring slaves as well as Civil War soldiers, languid antebellum women, cotton fields, steamships, trains, churches, and other period structures. Words from slave songs and Bible hymns, and texts about “The War of Independence,” the Mason and Dixon Line, and Gettysburg are dispersed throughout the work.
 
 ART OF HISTORYHistory is about power, and its depiction is a consequential act. These two works—a technically refined casting of precious materials for a powerful monarch, and a group of movable wood figures celebrating a new democratic era—commemorate specific important moments in the political histories of their respective societies. The Edo figure glorifies the spirit of a deceased king, or oba, who ruled the kingdom of Benin at the height of its power. A motif on the figure's kilt depicting an elephant, whose trunk ends in a human right hand, identifies this work with the reign of the oba Esigie, who ruled from 1504 to 1550. Johannes Segogela's sculpture addresses the South African transition from the armed liberation struggle against whites-only apartheid rule into the new democratic era, born the following year with the multiracial elections that swept Nelson Mandela to power. The work suggests the need for South Africans to cast their weapons into the furnace.
 This photograph from early in Cindy Sherman’s artistic career indicates a burgeoning interest in what has become a lifelong investigation into using herself as subject. Produced in 1975, during her time as an art student at the State University of New York, Buffalo, the work prefigures her famous Untitled Film Stills series by two years. In it, the artist references Claude Cahun, an early Surrealist photographer whose androgynous self-portraits inspired a later generation of feminist theorists to think about gender as a social role that is performed rather than innate—ideas that would become central to Sherman’s oeuvre from the mid-1970s onward.
 A modern-day coat of arms assembled from images of luxury consumer items, this collage could be regarded as a catalogue of status symbols coveted by contemporary celebrities. Within the traditional heraldic format, the central image of rapper LL Cool J is flanked by large gold Rolex watches. Inspired by coats of arms on the facades of historical European buildings, Rashaad Newsome brings this tradition, which originated in the mid-twelfth century, into the present.
 The Coney Island Polar Bear Club, the earliest organization of its kind, was founded in 1903 by Bernarr Macfadden, known as the “Father of Physical Culture.” An early advocate for outdoor exercise, Macfadden believed that taking a dip in the ocean during the winter could restore one’s immunity and stamina. Here, members of the Polar Bear Club pose on the beach on a snowy winter day.
 While spiders may be threatening creatures to many people, for Louise Bourgeois they represent a nurturing quality that she associates with her mother. In a maternal fashion, the spider weaves a perfect web that serves as a protective barrier and provides food. For Bourgeois, the spider also suggests the patience and industriousness that served her mother well as a skilled weaver in the family business of tapestry restoration. Thus, the image of the spider is capable of evoking both threat and tenderness; such a meeting of supposed opposites or a reconciliation of conflicting or even contradictory states is one of the most characteristic features of Louise Bourgeois’s art.
This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 Jean-Michel Othoniel has transformed this utilitarian vehicle—a nineteenth-century covered wagon known as a prairie schooner—into an elegant object of beauty by remaking its canvas cover with panes of blown glass and adding swags and finials composed of oversized glass beads.The artist, who favors alterable materials, began working with sulfur and wax and since 1993 has also experimented with the possibilities presented by glass. The potential for transformation that occurs with this material is echoed here by themes of migration and social change suggested by the covered wagon, part of the collective memory and mythology of American culture.
 Sol LeWitt was a mentor to many younger artists and writers. He was so significant to Lippard’s thinking that she dedicated Six Years to him. While his own practice always led to materialized works, he defined his artistic method as Conceptual, because he would always start from an idea, often permutations of a basic form or repetition of an operation, which he called the “machine that makes the art.” These two sketches show him elaborating the multiple forms of open cubes, and some of the various configurations possible for parallel straight lines.
 Though Kehinde Wiley is best known for his painted portraits, here he shifts from painting to sculpture. In both the lift and turn of the young man’s head and the open V of his zippered collar, this bronze refers to an eighteenth-century marble bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon (see illustration).Yet in many other ways, Wiley’s work could hardly be more different: in substituting male for female, black for white, and present for past, he upends the earlier sculpture even as he quotes it. His radical reinterpretation encourages us to examine the stereotypes that can be found in portraiture.—Rujeko Hockley, Assistant Curator, Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum
 Ellen Lesperance creates knitting patterns based on examples of sweaters she finds in archival photographs of female activists, and then uses these pattern paintings as guides for her hand-knit “historic” sweaters. The neatly lettered title on this painting links it to direct action and political resistance, tracing the radical history of women imprisoned for spearheading antinuclear encampments in the 1980s. Displayed together, Lesperance’s painting and sweater engage this activist history, literally and metaphorically offering a pattern for a new generation.
 Judy Chicago created this test plate for her room-size installation The Dinner Party (on permanent view on the fourth floor of the Museum), a milestone in twentieth-century art. The installation is composed of a banquet arranged on a triangular table with thirty-nine place settings, each commemorating an important woman from history.Dedicated to the black abolitionist and feminist Sojourner Truth (1797–1883), this plate depicts weeping for the suffering of the slaves, a mask concealing the real self, and a fist raised in rage and defiance.
 Geometric and spare, Clay Ketter’s R.T.P.18.B is part of his Renovation Trace Paintings series, initiated in 1995. Constructed out of common building materials including wallboard, paint, and joint compound, this large panel resembles an actual section of a wall with a doorway flanked by cupboards. The image is enigmatic, in a number of ways: The wall could be in the process of either construction or demolition, the place either real or imaginary. Moreover, the muted tones and streamlined aesthetic recall both Bauhaus design and Minimalist sculpture. And, as both object and image, R.T.P.18.B straddles the categories of sculpture and painting. Whatever the object’s significance, the artist’s experience as a carpenter informs the subject and materials of his work.

 Anna Williams, an African American quilt-maker born and raised near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, made quilts throughout her life, incorporating scraps of traditional printed cottons, unusual synthetics, and woven or decorated fabrics such as the sequined pieces seen here. The artist’s bold approach combines traditional block settings with free-flowing improvisation and a masterful use of color. In the late 1980s, Williams’s unique style of quilt-making was recognized by artists and collectors, who encouraged her to exhibit and sell her work.
 Through the Large Glass documents one of Wilke’s most effective and well-known performances, in which she executed a languid striptease behind the cracked transparent surface of Marcel Duchamp’s famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass), 1915–23, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1976. Dressed in a fedora and a man’s white satin suit, she strikes a series of poses evoking the style of 1970s fashion photography and then strips, cleverly suggesting bride and bachelor simultaneously. In her self-conscious affectation of a fashion model, Wilke willfully uses her own image and her sexuality to confront the erotic representation of women in art history and popular culture.
 
 Nayland Blake is known for work that emphasizes issues of race and sexuality. He explores the complexity of racial and sexual identity and social prejudice, using the image of the rabbit to refer to not only gay sexuality and African American heritage but individual freedom from society’s classifications. In 2000 he stated, “I’m using the rabbit as this metaphor for something that’s sort of in-between race. Of indeterminate race. That came from thinking about Br’er Rabbit. . . . Those stories are West African folktales that came into this country with slaves. They’re like the progenitor of Bugs Bunny. So in thinking about my own racial identity, I kept sort of using this rabbit metaphor.”
 In the Quechua-speaking community of Chinchero, men and women wear distinctive garments that identify them by gender and community. Large garments such as this shawl are woven in two parts—symmetrical opposites that are sewn together. Wide blue bands called pampakuna, or fields, are set apart by multi-striped panels filled with colorful geometric designs. Shawls with indigo-blue fields are characteristic of Chinchero women's garments.
 Petah Coyne’s fantastical forms, presenting a beauty that slides into the grotesque, allude to death and decay. Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculpturesproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works—the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.Coyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.
 This work was inspired by Mickalene Thomas’s 2011 residency at the house and gardens of the French Impressionist painter Claude Monet (1840–1926) in Giverny, France (see illustration). Thomas responded strongly to the colors Monet selected for the rooms of his house, the collection of art that hung on the walls, and the views of the garden that were deliberately framed by the windows. The Giverny residency coincided with her adoption of interiors and landscape as motifs in her own work.
 As suggested by her assumed name, the artist known as Swoon is an admirer of urban art like that featured in the special exhibition Graffiti, on view elsewhere on this floor. Trained in printmaking in Prague and at Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute, she decided to take her own art to the streets in l999, pasting her large linoleum- and woodcuts, printed on thin paper, on the sides of the industrial buildings of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side.The artist’s main subjects are the people of the city, often her family members and friends but also strangers. “I go and look at people hanging out on the street,” she says. “So what I wind up with is actually a street scene—a portrait of the city.”Recently, Swoon has begun creating large, intricate installations in which layers of printed and cutout material projecting into space are supplemented by objects found in the street. Brooklyn Museum Installation is a site-specific work based on a 2003 piece called Coney Island Cyclone, after the landmark Brooklyn roller coaster. The artist translates the coaster’s image into an intricate web of printed fragments. The lacelike appearance reveals influences as various as Indonesian shadow puppets and the printing methods of German Expressionism.The artist’s attraction to Coney Island derives from an all-American fascination with this place of wonder, magic, and bizarre personages. For Swoon, who was born in Florida, Coney Island encapsulates New York and its never-ending surprises, possibilities, and mystery.

 This tapered water jar with a highly polished black surface has a bear-paw motif on its neck. Alluding to the Santa Clara legend of a bear that led people to water in a time of drought, the bear paw is placed upright, as if in prayer asking for rain and everlasting life. The bands around the jar, referred to as rainbows, are also considered prayers, to keep the water from evaporating. According to Margaret Tafoya, the bear paw and rainbow designs are gifts from her Santa Clara ancestors. Esta jarra alargada de superficie negra bruñida tiene un motivo de garra de oso en el cuello. Aludiendo a la leyenda Santa Clara en la cual un oso condujo a la gente al agua en tiempo de sequía, la garra de oso está colocada hacia arriba, como en una plegaria pidiendo lluvia y vida eterna. Las franjas alrededor de la jarra, semejando un arcoíris, también se consideran plegarias, para prevenir que se evapore el agua. De acuerdo con Margaret Tafoya, los diseños de garra de oso y el arcoíris son regalos de sus ancestros Santa Clara.
 Yoram Wolberger’s sculpture of a Native American warrior belongs to a series of monumental versions of the plastic toy figurines that the artist used to stage elaborate mock battles between cowboys and Indians during his youth. Though infused with nostalgia, Red Indian #4 also invokes the violence that permeates both popular childhood games and the history of indigenous peoples in North America. To create his sculpture, Wolberger took molds of toy figurines—objects that were themselves based on stock images of Native Americans in nineteenth-century landscape paintings of America’s wilderness. Such imagery helped to foster perceptions among non-Natives of Indians as uncivilized, hostile, and an impediment to national progress defined by westward expansion. The irregular “fins” around the edges of Wolberger’s sculpture, which mimic the seams of their mass-produced toy counterparts, symbolize the continuing proliferation of standardized images of Native Americans and the American frontier. Moreover, the lack of detail and the generic character of his warrior underscore the ways in which stereotypes deny historical circumstances and ignore the diversity of Native peoples.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Damian Wampler’s series Darfur in Brooklyn, to which this image belongs, is an oblique portrait of a crisis. Brooklyn is home to more than three hundred Sudanese refugees, most of them living in the borough’s Kensington section, not far from Prospect Park. Through following one of them, the cab driver Omer Omar (shown here in his kitchen), for several months, Wampler presents a powerful portrait of the daily life of a little-known population in the Museum’s extended neighborhood.
 Arlene Shechet, a ceramicist and sculptor, also creates handmade papers from abacá, a plant native to the Philippines and prized for its delicate fibers. These works simultaneously make reference to the floor plans of Buddhist shrines, Japanese aizuri-e prints, and blue-and-white porcelain. The Flow Blue series, from which this work derives, is named after a particular type of British transfer pottery popular during the early nineteenth century. Modeled after Asian blue-and-white porcelain, these wares are known for their deliberately blurred forms mimicking the marbled appearance of lapis lazuli.

 Roxanne Swentzell’s work often plays on the interaction between native and non-native worlds. Here she uses clay, an ancient artistic medium, to depict a traditional Pueblo woman, whose face is much like Swentzell’s own. The woman in the sculpture looks up at the Santa Clara black pot balanced on her head, from which babies are emerging. But there is a contemporary ironic twist to what the woman is doing: is she “birthing” pots to be sold at an Indian market, or is it the baby Indians themselves that the consumer will want to buy? The work challenges the viewer to acknowledge the treatment of Native Americans as a stereotype and commodity in representations by non-natives in popular culture and advertising.
 Drawn to the creative energy of America’s ever-changing postwar city landscapes, the Athens-born Chryssa made a name for herself with work that utilized innovative materials taken from urban environments. During the 1960s she produced vibrant paintings, prints, and illuminated sculpture made of neon tubing, Plexiglas, and aluminum. The two sculptures shown here evoke Chryssa’s fascination with Times Square and celebrate the giant blinking, pulsing signs of the city. Her paintings and prints of the period, her Newspaper series of paintings in particular, are considered among the earliest Pop experiments with typography and print media.
 A play on geometric abstract painting, James Hyde’s piece utilizes everyday materials in place of pigment. The pairing of magenta and blue reflects the colors often found in the Madonna’s flowing gown as depicted in Renaissance altarpieces. The draped blue tarp could be seen as mimicking the way the fabric drapes around her feet.
 This photograph shows three women around a dining-room table, a symbol of a communal family ritual. But instead of facing each other, they are absorbed by their laptop computers. The women appear blurry and ghostlike, almost as if they have been transported to another world through the glowing screens. It is the inanimate physical objects throughout the room that come into view in detail, hinting at the transience of human existence as well as the sometimes alienating effects of contemporary communication. Pillsbury uses ambient lighting produced by the electronic devices that permeate our lives—such as televisions, computer screens, and cell phones—combined with long exposure times to create photographs that examine our relationships with these devices and the objects and people around us.
 Come Away from Her is based on a manuscript drawing by Lewis Carroll for his book Alice's Adventures Under Ground (1864). At this point in his story, friendly birds fly off when Alice talks about what her cat likes to eat. In Kiki Smith's prints based on fairytales, childhood vulnerability and innocence like Alice's can be imbued with a sense of the sexual awakening that accompanies adolescence, and the animals sometimes shown with young girls suggest underlying forces of nature. Here we witness a cryptic scene, as Alice watches winged forms, some of them with incongruous limbs, fly away from her.
 Dale Chihuly is the best-known glass artist in the United States. Trained at the University of Wisconsin and the Rhode Island School of Design, he received the first Fulbright Fellowship in glass and went to Venice in 1968 to study at Venini, the most progressive glass factory in Italy. In 1971 he established the Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle, the only American art school devoted entirely to glassmaking. His affinity for the Northwest is profound; he has strong ties to the landscape and great interest in the arts of the native peoples there. This particular work was inspired by the traditional woven baskets of the Haida and other Northwest Coast tribes.Chihuly has moved from small-scale vases of recognizable form to art that transcends the boundaries of traditional glassmaking. As this "basket" demonstrates, he has abandoned functionalism in favor of large sculptural forms. Often he and his assistants work on a grand scale, creating large environments composed of many thousands of glass elements for specific sites. In 1994, he created Brooklyn Wall, a temporary installation in the Museum's lobby.
 This blown-glass sculpture has a red and black design, the two signature colors for Northwest Coast art. It represents a killer whale, one of the crest designs of the Tlingit glass-blower Preston Singletary. The surface incorporates traditional form-line designs with the black outlining the positive, primary spaces and the deeply cut red shaping the negative, secondary spaces of the whale's body. This reflects the same style of design used in traditional mediums such as totem poles, Tlingit Chilkat blankets, rattles, and other ritual paraphernalia. All such artworks reflect visual histories and designs owned by hereditary right by each Native artist.Singletary trained at the famous Pilchuck Glass School in Seattle with glass artists such as Lino Tagliapetra and Cicco Ongaro but credits the Isleta Pueblo glassblower Tony Jojola with inspiring him to switch from making European-style works to creating from within his own Tlingit culture. Singletary has become the leader of a rapidly developing, innovative Native American glass art movement.
 ART OF POWERAlthough art has historically glorified the powerful, it can also be a means of communication and expression for those without power. These Congolese works represent opposite ends of the social spectrum. The mwaash aMbooy mask is emblematic of royal power and prestige for the Kuba kingdom of the central Congo. It represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba trace their descent, and is worn only by the king (nyim) or by local chiefs. In both its dance and as a sculpture, it is a vision of gravity and composure. The contemporary portraits by Aimé Mpane, in turn, depict the struggles of those without access to power. They show ordinary citizens of Kinshasa, along with representations of their fears and desires. The artist carves these images from plywood, turning two-dimensional surfaces into works filled with light and shadow (suggesting both presence and absence) that animate the stories of the dispossessed.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.

 In Japan, Raku ware (Raku-yaki) is usually associated with the tea ceremony. It developed during the Momoyama period (1573â1615) when the first generation of the Raku family is said to have made tea bowls for Sen no Rikyū (1522â1591), the renowned tea master. Raku ware was once restricted to ceramics specifically made by the Raku family, but today its techniques are widely used.
 Shigaraki ware is associated with tea bowls and other utensils for the tea ceremony. However, the technique was first utilized to produce tiles for the roof of Shigaraki palace, which was built for Emperor Shōmu (reigned 724–49) of the Tenpyō period. Later, during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the technique was used for utilitarian vessels, including water jars, large pots, and farming implements. Only after the Muromachi period (1392–1573) was Shigaraki ware used for tea bowls.
 Ido ware was first made as inexpensive rice bowls in fifteenth-century Korea. When Ido ware was imported to Japan, people started to employ it for the tea ceremony, and Ido tea bowls were highly respected. The attraction of this example is its powerful form, featuring a relatively tall footed base in the shape of a bamboo stem, and its glaze pattern, which resemble the dry skin of an old plum tree.
 Shino ware was produced in the Mino area of Japan (in modern Gifu prefecture near Nagoya) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1574–1600), mainly for the tea ceremony. Shino glazes, which are always thick, come in shades of red or gray, but white is the most popular. White Shino tea bowls were in high demand among tea masters, as the white color expresses purity and is considered a perfect presentation of the spirit of the tea ceremony.
 Kohiki ware was brought to Japan from Korea, where it was known as Punch'ong ware. It takes its name from the Japanese for "ground powder," an allusion to the ware's powder-fine glaze. Kohiki ware tea bowls, famous for their deep bodies, were admired by samurai warriors of the late sixteenth century who relished the tea ceremony.
 By the time Brooklyn-based Lorna Simpson completed her M.F.A. at the University of California, San Diego, in 1985, she was already gaining recognition for her large-scale photographs focusing on the female African American figure. Subtly addressing issues of racial and gender identity in American society, she juxtaposed text with her photographs, continually presenting her female subject as anonymous by hiding part of her face or choosing a view of the figure’s back. Thus the viewer never knew these women as individuals. In Counting, Simpson presents us with three images: an African American woman, a brick hut, and braids. As in most of her work, the meaning is open-ended, but the adjacent texts suggest that the work deals with labor and slavery. The woman is paired with time slots that could imply work shifts. Text alluding to the beginning of slavery appears with a Southern smokehouse once used as a slave hut. The image of braids coupled with the text “25 twists, 70 braids, 50 locks” implies the arrangement of multiple, intricate braids, a cultural trait sometimes associated with African American women.
 Wishing Well is Thomas Woodruff’s meditation on the ravages of the AIDS epidemic rendered in the style of an Old Master painting. The initials of the artist’s departed friends are inscribed on the work, which follows the composition of the central panel of the Adoration of the Lamb from the famous Ghent Altarpiece, completed by Hubert and Jan van Eyck in 1432. Echoing the paradisical scene, with its references to the sacrificial lamb of the Crucifixion and the fountain of life, Woodruff places a plentitude of apples, birds, and rabbits around a wishing well. As in the proverb “an apple a day,” the apples suggest the possibility of healing and overcoming the menace of AIDS through hope, joy, and appreciation of the everyday miracles of life. This painting was the central piece of the artist’s exhibition Apple Canon, where it was installed with 365 images of various kinds of apples depicted with the precision of Flemish genre painting.
 The buildup of pigment and modeling clay on the velvet surface of Rockets Redglare in Paradise exemplifies the intense materiality of Julian Schnabel’s paintings from the early 1980s, a decade that saw a revived interest in the medium of painting and in expressionist brushwork. Reminiscing in 1996, Schnabel recalled that he had encountered Michael Morra, a well-known downtown actor and standup comedian whose stage name was Rockets Redglare (taken from “The Star-Spangled Banner”), on his way to see the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. When Schnabel heard that Basquiat planned to make a painting of Rockets, Schnabel invited the performer to his studio instead and subsequently created this likeness.
 When Astroland first opened in 1962, it included two of the classic Coney Island rides: the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel (left of center in this image). In 2006 the owners sold Astroland to a developer who had already assembled a large amount of land in Coney Island’s old amusement area. A short-term lease will allow Astroland to reopen next summer, but as this text goes to press, it remains unclear whether the developer’s plan for towering hotels, shops, restaurants, movie theaters, and high-tech entertainment will be accepted or rebuffed by city authorities.In the past few years, attempts to revitalize Coney Island have increased; KeySpan Park and the new Stillwell Avenue subway station are the most obvious examples. While many agree that rejuvenation is necessary, voices have been raised against the prospect of turning Coney Island into a gentrified enclave for the well-off. New York City’s creation of a Coney Island Development Corporation in 2003 brought together city officials as well as local business and community leaders. This initiative indicated awareness of the importance of caring for the area’s traditional qualities and of keeping it available to a diverse audience while providing a wide-ranging plan for economic development that would include a year-round amusement district as well as many new residential opportunities. At this moment, it is uncertain what the result of these efforts will be.
 The rise of Coney Island in the postwar years was temporary, and from the 1950s, Coney was in steady decline. Postwar suburbanization, car culture, and the creation of parkways and public state parks such as Jones Beach offered people alternatives for day trips in the summer. Robert Moses, New York City’s powerful Parks Commissioner, objected to the kind of entertainment Coney offered with its penny arcades, shooting galleries, rides, and sideshows. In 1938 his Parks Department took control of the beach at Coney Island, with efforts to increase public access and reduce the amusements. In the 1950s and 1960s large areas were used for new housing projects built on Moses’s initiative. Widespread gang violence in the 1950s frightened some visitors, and when Steeplechase closed for good in 1964, the area dedicated to amusement was dramatically reduced. Nevertheless, Coney Island as a democratic destination for everyone subsisted, as testified here in Stephen Salmieri’s many images from the late 1960s.
 Ana Mendieta: Place and PresenceBefore graduating from the University of Iowa in 1972, Ana Mendieta had already embarked upon her unique practice of blending photography, body art, earth art, and performance art as she addressed the emergence of feminism and her experience as a Cuban exile.For her iconic Silueta series, Mendieta placed her body in the landscape, using materials such as crushed flowers, sculpted mud, or ignited gunpowder to literally inscribe her silhouette, and then documented the ephemeral results through photographs and films. Returning to Cuba in 1980 and 1981, she continued to trace female forms on the ground, as in the pieces executed on the beach in Guanabo. She also began carving fertility figures into the caves and cliffs of her native land, which she called Rupestrian Sculptures. Many of these, such as the large Untitled (Guanaroca [First Woman]), were named after indigenous goddesses, simultaneously serving as political and personal assertions of Mendieta’s presence and identity, as well as reminders of ancient traditions of goddess worship.
 This is a monumental elegy for the Irish Republican Army member and long-term prisoner Mairead Farrell, who, along with two unarmed male companions, was shot to death at close range in 1988, in Gibraltar, by the British Security Service. The ghostly text in the upper right—“Your mind is your strongest weapon because they can’t control your mind they can’t get inside and that’s their failure”—was taken from one of Farrell’s last interviews. Doogan’s concentration on the female martyr is in keeping with her long-standing interest in depicting the female body with a clear-eyed realism and care worthy of Renaissance masters such as Albrecht Dürer, evident in the sensuous drapery that shrouds the martyr and the blood that seeps from her ear into the water below.
 In the wake of its humiliating defeat at the hands of Prussia in 1870, the French Third Republic sought to reinvigorate notions of heroism and citizenship. To this end, in 1884 the city council of Calais commissioned Rodin to create a monument to Eustache de Saint-Pierre. In 1347, while Calais was under siege by the English, Eustache and five other important citizens of the town had offered themselves as hostages, pleading for mercy for their long-suffering city.In his first maquette of 1884, Rodin proposed a conventional monument, with his figures united as a group on a tall pedestal. By the following year, however, the six figures were placed on a low rectangular plinth, at the same level as the viewer. As Rodin later wrote: "I wanted to have my statues placed in front of the Calais city hall on the very paving of the square like a living rosary of suffering and sacrifice."Rodin first made nude figure studies, which he then draped in wet canvas to model the sackcloth worn by the burghers when they surrendered. To create the expressive figures possible, he used the radical technique of combining studies of hands and feet from different figures. Creating the very antithesis of conventional heroic sculpture, Rodin here set out the terms of a modern, anti-monumental tradition that resonates to this day.
 These two works are part of a large series of soldiers’ portraits by the New York–based photographer Suzanne Opton. Opton photographed Claxton and Mickelson on their return to Fort Drum, New York, from service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Asking each to rest his head on a table, she shot the horizontal face close up, against a dark background. The images of these disembodied heads reveal every pore and blemish, even a wandering eyelash. Psychological portraits more than traditional representations of heroes, the exposed faces seem thoughtful and oddly tranquil, vulnerable in their naked intimacy.

 Sarah Hobbs explores the world of phobias and aspects of erratic human behavior in her constructed environments. Untitled (Eggs) is one of a number of works by the artist that focus on an obsessive gathering of selected objects. Here the viewer is drawn into the image by the seeming perfection of the eggs, which on closer examination reveal extensive flaws and cracks. Because the objects are presented approximately life-size, they relate directly to human scale, but humans are eerily absent from this photograph and similar works by the artist.
In Steffani Jemison’s Personal, three black men— professional actors based in Brooklyn who responded to an ad Jemison placed—move improvisationally through various locations in Bed-Stuy. Shot against an unfinished mural, in a public park, and on a playing field, the actors walk forward, backward, and in slow circles, with the world around them largely unaffected by their movement. Jemison moves between letting the footage play naturally and reversing it, making it unclear if the action is unfolding in real time or not. Techniques of repetition and reversal confuse time, space, and sequence. These strategies provoke viewers to consider the impact of inherited narratives and question notions of linear progress, particularly in relation to black Americans.
 Like much of Wangechi Mutu's work, Eat Cake focuses on a female protagonist: here, a mysterious woman (played by Mutu) with unkempt hair, clawlike nails, and translucent platform heels. Materializing at water's edge against a soundtrack of tinkling bells and birdcalls, she squats before a multitiered chocolate cake and then messily devours it. Hunched over and swaying, she appears both primal and enchanted. The woman's decadent clothing and voracious appetite invite reflection on our separation from the natural world and patterns of excessive consumption, while her ritualistic movements suggest an attempt to reconnect with both the earthly and spirit realms of the forest around her. Placed on the floor, Eat Cake forces us to bend over or even squat, mimicking the woman’s position and, perhaps, also that of women in society at large.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 
 With this work, the Brooklyn Museum debuts the recent acquisition of a significant collection of artworks from the Black Arts Movement, considered the cultural wing of the Black Power Movement in the late 1960s and 1970s. Nelson Stevens was a member of the Chicago-based collective AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists). AfriCOBRA used what they called “coolade colors” to create empowering images of African Americans—which they deemed “Superreal images for Superreal people.” Here a woman with an afro (then a highly political hairstyle) casts her gaze upward, as if envisioning a day when African Americans would be truly free. The word uhuru means “freedom” in Swahili, and the choice of language signaled the group’s Afrocentric politics.
 In this mixed-media collage, Ralph Arnold, a participant in the Black Arts Movement in Chicago, combined what may seem to be disparate images of politics and sports. The photograph at the lower center of the canvas shows a very young Julian Bond, then a leader of the civil rights organization Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The images of football players layered against the montage of black men marching and soldiering may also be a commentary on racial equality, since the artist created this collage at a moment when the National Football League, an organization slow to integrate, merged with the American Football League, which recruited from historically black colleges and universities.
 The artist states, "This painting is from a group of on-site works of the same location, executed at the same time of day, sunset, over the period of one year. Together they function as a set of mug shots of the place where victims of three unrelated murders were found over the previous year. One evening, as I was painting in my car, a crowd of spectators began to gather along the levee across the road. With toddlers perched on their shoulders and small children jumping at their sides, parents elbowed for an unobstructed view of officials pulling the waterlogged body of a man, victim #4, from the Trinity River [outside Fort Worth, Texas]."
 In these two photographs from the 1990s, Anthony Randell captures the atmosphere in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as DUMBO (short for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) before its gentrification. The area was developed as a manufacturing district, close to the Fulton Ferry landing, in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. In the wake of the de-industrialization of the Brooklyn waterfront, artists moved into the decaying district in the 1970s in search of large studio space and cheap rents. Over the past fifteen years, developers converted many of the old buildings to luxury apartments and turned the waterfront into an attractive park. While the area today is thriving, most artists have been forced to move to less expensive Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Bushwick and Sunset Park.

 In this drawing Duke Riley presents real and imagined accounts about the original residents as well as an imaginary group of contemporary inhabitants of Mill Rock Island, a small, inhospitable strip of land just north of Roosevelt Island in the East River of New York. Initially named Bright Passage or Hell Gate by Dutch explorers, the island and the river become a mythical place in Riley’s densely rendered scenes. Influenced by tattoo art as well as woodcuts and nineteenth-century whaling art, this large-scale drawing invites the viewer to find hidden treasures and stories depicting tales of sexual exploits with pirates, mermaids and other mythical creatures. Part of Riley’s vast multimedia project East River Incognita 1, The Bright Passage further evokes the ambiguous line between history and myth by including fragments and landmarks of contemporary life in New York.
 Sol LeWitt, active from the 1960s, was a pioneer of Minimalism and Conceptual art. He often worked with simple geometric forms—particularly the cube—straight lines, and ninety-degree angles. Hanging Structure’s suspended three-dimensional grid, composed of identical, monochromatic units, is emblematic of this interest. In contrast, Terence Koh, inspired by queer, punk, and DIY cultures, belongs to a 1990s generation whose work is more personally inflected. Embracing decay and ephemerality, Untitled (Vitrines) displays whitewashed objects collected from friends, lovers, Koh’s childhood, and flea markets, acting almost as a shrine preserving relics from his life. The sculpture departs significantly from LeWitt’s strict vision yet engages with the legacies of Minimalism and Conceptual art, exploring the possibilities of the grid and the monochrome and extending those formal considerations into the personal realm.
 Kiki Smith is known for her ongoing engagement with bodily matter and the female form, often through fairy tales and folklore. The title of the set to which this lithograph belongs—Banshee Pearls—combines terms with very different connotations. Pearls have long signified upper-class elegance and femininity, while a banshee is a female spirit in Irish mythology whose chilling screams and ghostlike pallor are omens of death. The word banshee is still used to describe women or girls who are seen as wild or inappropriately behaved. Here, repeating deathlike masks of a woman’s face ask the viewer to consider how female powerrelates to beauty and the grotesque.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 Titi in Window and Luis’s Mother are part of a series of works completed by John Ahearn and his collaborator, Rigoberto Torres, in the Longwood neighborhood of the South Bronx. Starting in 1979 and continuing throughout the 1980s, a time when this community was struggling economically and socially, Ahearn and Torres created plaster castings of their neighbors and friends. The two sculptors would often cast their subjects on the sidewalk, and then display the finished busts publicly on walls in the neighborhood.

 Throughout her career, Louise Bourgeois experimented with various methods of representing body fragments in her sculptures. Many of them employ roughly finished marble blocks, with the exquisitely carved figurative elements seamlessly growing from the stone mass. Hands appear frequently among these pieces. As the most important tool of the artist, hands are celebrated in many forms. They are expressive of character and mood, and serve in the process of communication. The two finely carved hands in Décontractée appear in a moving gesture that suggests the relaxation and release that might follow a painful experience.
 Alec Soth creates a visual record of America. In his series Sleeping by the Mississippi, he depicts not only the people and places that make up life along the river, but also the shift in culture as the river flows from north to south. Soth presents these photographs as a fragmented narrative, a rambling sequence of images similar to the flow of dream imagery or the currents of the unconscious. With his interest in the representation of the United States and its inhabitants, his portraits express a wide range of feelings, from pride to loneliness and vulnerability.This image shows a man bundled in workman’s clothes against a bleak rural landscape; he presents model airplanes to the viewer, as if explaining a project. With its implicit references to the iconic American aviator Charles Lindbergh (whose unassuming boyhood bed is shown in another photograph in the group) and to the very idea of America (in the colors and emblematic stars and stripes on one of the planes), the image is both an intimate, personal portrait of a man and his toys and a link to the rest of the series.
 This image is part of the photographer Harvey Wang’s photographic series of endangered occupations. A testament to New York City’s rapid changes, it is not only a document of a vanishing chapter of the city’s history but also an intimate portrayal of the people who held these jobs: mannequin makers, pillow makers, and scrap-metal collectors. Coney’s Cyclone roller coaster no longer has a brakeman.
 William Hawkings was born in eastern Kentucky at the end of the nineteenth century. When he was two years old, his mother died, and Hawkings was sent to live on his grandparents' farm. Although he moved to Columbus, Ohio, as a young man, much of his work depicts idyllic agrarian life, the memories of his childhood. Self-taught as an artist, Hawkins could not afford to purchase commercial frames for his paintings, and he typically painted a decorative border around his pictures.
 In this image, Willie Cole uses an iron to connect with painful and lingering histories of racial oppression, commenting on the extent to which the marks of the past live on in the present. The iron, which left a singed impression in the middle panel, suggests domestic service (Cole’s mother and grandmother both worked as housekeepers), but its form also recalls both the European ships that carried captive African laborers to the Americas and historical African masks.In the first and third panels, Cole superimposes the iron-as-mask image over his own face. By connecting a suggestion of iron marks to his face in the first panel, Cole further evokes the manner in which history has marked his body. He suggests both ritual scarification patterns and the branding irons that turned the bodies of African laborers into Western commodities.
 In the late sixties I was thinking about the triumph of the Cuban people over imperialism and U.S. dominance—the effort is here "crowned" (Corona). But Corona is also a famous cigar from Havana that is desired (and now missed) by affluent Yankees—so struggle, victory, and contradictions are part of the idea. I was working my way out of a more lyrical and abstract view of figuration at the time toward a more socially-politically oriented idiom, hoping to find a way to maintain a formally strong image. . . . This painting is in transition. . . . The form is evolving toward artistic and social relevancy. The painting has particular interest to me since it straddles these objectives and balances precariously, one foot in each world.

 Sadegh Tirafkan explores the layering of traditional and modern Iranian culture and the conflicts between Iranian and western culture in his photographs, collages, and video installations. In this photograph, the first portrait in a series entitled The Loss of Our Identity, the artist presents the viewer with a portrait of an Iranian youth in a white T-shirt with headphones, both attributes of western culture. His eyes, however, are hidden beneath a superimposed “curtain” created from a reproduction of a battle scene illustrated in a Qajar period Persian lithographed book. The image seems to question the deterioration of traditional Iranian culture in the face of an increasingly superficial world driven by new media. Tirafkan belongs to a group of contemporary Muslim artists whose work is increasingly sought by collectors and museums in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The Brooklyn Museum is proud to present this work as the first contemporary addition to its Arts of the Islamic World collection.
 Despite its having the mane of a male lion, the female body and attributes identify this striding figure as Sakhmet, whose name literally means “The Powerful One,” or another lion-headed goddess. Her attributes include a sun disk and uraeus (rearing cobra) on her head, which together connect her with the sun god Re and emphasize her roles as his daughter, the “Eye of the Sun” and protector of the king. The papyrus scepter in her left hand evokes regeneration and rebirth, among her divine responsibilities.
 Betty Woodman, the doyenne of American studio ceramics, has had a keen interest in the art of antiquity and other cultures since the beginning of her career in the 1950s. Here she has transposed the form of an ancient Japanese ceremonial bronze bell known as the dotaku into terra-cotta and then covered the handbuilt bell with a lustrous glaze, terra sigillata, inspired by ancient Roman redware.
 Converting found materials into a unique medium between sculpture and painting, El Anatsui combines diverse aesthetic traditions from Ghana, Nigeria, and the global history of abstraction. Working with discarded metal bottle caps collected from a liquor distillery, Anatsui modifies this unremarkable everyday material, chosen for both its physical qualities and its bodily connection to the original consumer, to make vast, undulating sheets. Anatsui’s sheets are pieced together and hung without prescribed orientation, taking on new shapes with each installation. This “non-fixed form,” as the artist calls it, is emblematic of Anatsui’s desire for his work to remain dynamic, inspiring creativity in those who install it and illustrating the ever-changing conditions of life.In Black Block, Anatsui uses only one color (though the black is broken up by flashes of red and yellow) and only one type of metal piece across a monumental expanse of some 15,000 elements.
 In this serene painting, Emmi Whitehorse achieves a unique balance between her modern art training and her Native heritage. Born and raised on the Navajo reservation, she lived with her grandmother and was surrounded by Navajo stories and cultural traditions. For Whitehorse, the Southwest landscape is her identity and the source of her inspiration. In this painting, loosely formed abstractions fill the surface and float in a hazy, fluid medium that could be a mirage of heat or a sandstone cliff. The floating, abstract shapes resemble seeds, pods, and roots of plants, imagery that also relates to Navajo weaving, in which plants are used as dye sources. As a child, Whitehorse collected plants with her grandmother, who hung them on the walls of their house to dry. That is the origin of the floating vegetal forms.
In his diverse body of work, Roxy Paine often deals with nature and artifice, particularly the tension between natural processes and the constructed environment. Encased in a glass box with a wooden floor and frames, the replica of a Datura plant in this piece has been domesticated. With leaves half-devoured by insects, it looks deceptively harmless—and still quite beautiful—in its decaying state. Nevertheless, the Datura is a dangerously poisonous plant. It contains scopolamine and atropine, which in very low doses can be used both as medications and as powerful hallucinogens, transporting the user to otherworldly states of consciousness. Yet, an overdose of these substances is fatal.
 Fritz Scholder, ambivalent about identifying himself as a Native American artist, often chose an objective stance in portraying Native subjects. This lithograph belongs to a series in which he challenged stereotypical perceptions of the Indian as noble, pure, and a symbol of wisdom. Standing inert with an indecipherable expression, the figure nevertheless exudes a strange power, waiting for something the viewer can only guess.
 What is Native American art and who is a Native American artist? The artist Fritz Scholder referred to himself as a non-Indian Indian, someone who never felt the pull of two different cultures. With this lithograph series he challenges popular stereotypical depictions of Indians as stoic, noble, pure, and the embodiment of wisdom. Instead, he offers an amorphous human form, showing only a scruffy face with an open mouth, though the hint of a warrior breastplate, the wrapped braids, and the sharply angled feather suggest a Native American identity. The figure’s tightly wrapped blanket and his turned pose seem to reject empathy from the viewer.
 Fritz Scholder’s imagery in paintings and prints frequently explores atypical views of Native American life. Most depictions of this subject feature the vibrant colors of the regalia and the swirling action of the Buffalo dancers, performing in celebration of their past. Instead, Scholder offers a somber depiction of the haunted soul of a man with hollow eyes. His vacant stare implies that the past is dead, the present is empty, and the future cannot be envisioned.
 Fritz Scholder’s imagery in paintings and prints frequently explores the cultural contradictions of late twentieth-century Native American life. He often shows harsh realities but sometimes presents a humorous view, as in this lithograph, in which warriors on horseback carry non-native, innocuously jaunty umbrellas. This seemingly improbable scene is actually taken from real life; umbrellas have been used by both men and women as protection from the hot sun on the Plains since the late nineteenth century.
 Helen Levitt's photograph of two children on a New York street is a wonderful example of her prolific engagement with street life. The capacity to transform the documentary into poetry, to interpret a scene on the street from a humanistic perspective and give it a new meaning, is a key feature of Brooklyn-born Levitt's lifelong photographic practice, always more artistic than journalistic.  The seemingly simple structure of this image reveals a skillful sense of composition. The graffiti and the many layers of advertisements on the back wall echo the black scribbles on the face of the boy on the left, his vertically striped pants juxtaposed with the horizontal bands of the wall in the background. Quietly and full of concentration, he is gazing at the other boy, slightly out of focus, carefully handling a bubble.Levitt studied with Walker Evans in New York in the late 1930s and began photographing city children in the 1940s, always imbuing her subjects with characteristic warmth. In 1970, she was one of the first street photographers to begin working in color.
 Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1911, Romare Bearden moved with his family to New York City in 1915, where in the 1930s he attended New York University, studied art with George Grosz at the Art Students League, and joined artists' groups associated with the Harlem Renaissance. While maintaining his strong connection with New York, Bearden frequently returned to his grandparents' house in North Carolina for the summer, and memories of the South were to inspire many of his works, such as Southern Courtyard.
 Kara Walker has succeeded in developing a signature visual vocabulary that is instantly recognizable for its engagement with both nineteenth-century imaging techniques and the historical period of the American antebellum South. In Keys to the Coop, Walker depicts a young African American girl in bold silhouette, holding the decapitated head of a chicken in one hand, while in the other she nonchalantly twirls a large key. Walker portrays a self-empowered anti-heroine who possesses the key to her own salvation, in stark black-and-white. This image also provocatively alludes to food, gender, and racial mythologies, subjects that Walker often foregrounds in her work.
 This print evokes one of the key visual metaphors associated with Kali, who is sometimes depicted as pure geometric abstraction, in the form of a yantra, rather than as a multilimbed goddess. Yantras are spiritual visualization instruments specific to the philosophy and ritual of Tantra, a sect of both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Kali yantra is a red and black diagram of interlocking triangles, lotus petals, and geometric forms, and is one of several symbolic representations of shakti (female divine energy). The inverted triangle also resonates with the contemporary use of pink and black triangles as symbols of queer identity.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 This large-scale painting is one in an ongoing Collaboration series begun in the mid-1970s, in which Schapiro dialogues with and pays homage to famous women artists, in this instance Frida Kahlo, whose self-portrait The Broken Column, 1944, is reproduced in the center. Schapiro is a pioneering feminist artist who, with Judy Chicago, founded the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, the first program of its kind to encourage women to make art from their personal experiences. A leader in the Pattern and Decoration movement, Schapiro is known for her “femmages,” or collage paintings, which aim to reclaim traditional handicrafts associated with women’s work, such as embroidery and sewing. Stylistically this painting mimics the look of a collage, recalling Schapiro’s long-standing commitment to the belief that decorative elements and women’s work are viable artistic means to express female experience, having both political and subversive potential.
 This water jar of classic Pueblo shape by Marcellus and Elizabeth Toya Medina, a husband and wife team, illustrates both the old and the new. Circling the jar, in the background, are depictions of traditional masked Kachinas who perform in religious ceremonies. Bursting into dance in front of these figures are naturalistic, muscled, male Pueblo dancers in very active dance positions, also wearing traditional regalia.
 Vija Celmins derives many of her images from photographs and is particularly interested in translating three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional surfaces. Internationally known for her intensely realistic renditions of natural environments, the artist here also conveys a sense of abstraction and illusion. Celmins recently turned her attention to spiderwebs after making images of bodies of water, skies, and sandy deserts for many years. “Maybe I identify with the spider,” she once stated. “I’m the kind of person who works on something forever and then works on the same image again the next day.”
 Sylvia Plimack Mangold's The Inversion is full of polarities: images compete with a void, geometry conflicts with nature, traditional landscape painting faces off against abstraction. The artist began The Inversion as a larger work, and it forms a narrative about the painting process: "The landscape originally stretched horizontally from left to right, side to side," she wrote. "I cropped it because it didn't work—the negation of some areas becomes a positive element in the support of the total picture." In other words, the void at the right is a kind of negative "inversion" of the positive landscape.
 Cindy Sherman’s reputation was built on the success of her Untitled Film Stills, a series of black-and-white photographs from the late 1970s in which the artist depicted herself in various typecast roles of the Hollywood heroine. In that series, she described how the male gaze reduces the female subject to stereotype. The series Fairy Tales and Disasters of the mid- to late 1980s marked a major shift in Sherman’s self-representation. External appearance became the means by which to explore the contents of an internal world, one influenced by fairytales, myths, and fantasy. If the Untitled Film Stills expressed a sense of anxiety about the lurking male gaze, then the Fairy Tales, such as this one, reveal a monstrous “other” we all carry inside. The harsh, sickly greenish-yellow lighting emphasizes the slobbering lips, decaying teeth, and tense fists of this character. The vulnerable girls and alluring temptresses of the Film Stills are replaced by grotesque figures emerging from some netherworld.
 My mother had the idea to shoot a portrait of me wearing this T-shirt printed with a Huxtable family portrait. As a child I watched The Cosby Show in order to escape the reality of my dismantled working-class family. My mother set up the camera in the bedroom doorway, facing a mirror reflecting part of her image. Both the mirror and the T-shirt are scratched, dusty, and fading in the light. In the text that I perform live, for this particular photograph I wrote, “Between my background and my foreground, I am not sure where I stand.”—LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 I found out in 2008 that both Grandma Ruby and Mom had cancer, as did many of the elder women in Braddock. Here, Mom and I explored a new approach to documenting our illnesses (mine being lupus). We stood our mattress on end and covered it with a comforter, essentially making it our studio/stage. We made a portrait of our bodies overlapping as one, unified in sickness, death, and our struggle to survive. The light cast a shadow that for me foreshadows the loss of Grandma Ruby; she passed away six months later from pancreatic cancer. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 In Self-Portrait (March 10 a.m.) I continued to document my lupus attacks. Any time I am having a lupus attack and feel up to making a portrait, I document the moment. On this occasion I had just returned from clearing out my grandmother’s apartment in Braddock after her death. I only kept a few articles of her clothing. In this portrait I am wearing her pajama pants, and a bed sheet is duct-taped to the bedroom wall. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 Although now known primarily as a landscape painter, Sylvia Plimack Mangold engaged in the realistic depiction of domestic interiors until the mid-1970s. In this painting she painstakingly describes the geometry created by a patterned parquet floor strewn with articles of clothing. Using exaggerated perspective, the artist leads us into the depth of space, implying the large scale of the room. In contrast to the elaborately set up interiors that were the subject of paintings through the nineteenth century, Mangold presents a segment of a modern household where everyone is rushing, and tidying up is the last thing on anyone's mind.
 Gordon Matta-Clark is best known for his “building cuts,” turning buildings into sculptural environments by carving through floors, walls, and ceilings. He dubbed these site-specific transformations “Anarchitecture” (a combination of “anarchy” and “architecture”); they were documented in films and photographs that were subsequently exhibited in galleries, sometimes alongside sections of the cut-out buildings. In connection with his Super 8mm film Underground Paris (1977), exploring the complex underground spaces of the city, Matta-Clark made a series of photographic works of the same title. These represent another type of cut, this time deep into the ground, where the built environment is contrasted with the city’s many buried stories. In Underground Paris: St. Michel, Matta-Clark photographed the catacombs beneath the center of Paris and created a larger image by combining many smaller photographs, often making visible the edges of the strips of negatives. This montage of several similar-looking images, both color and black and white, refers back to the Super 8mm film, taking a form like a filmstrip. At the same time, the horizontal seams between the images allude to geological layers, just as the work’s extreme vertical format mimics the descending movement necessary to reach these hidden and forgotten burial grounds. The city is visible above, with its roofline and the highlighted silhouette of a church emphasizing the contrast between past and present.
 Made in the year of Ralph Ellison’s death, Black Monolith II (For Ralph Ellison) is an homage to the author of Invisible Man that expands the possibilities of painting. It is part of a larger series by Jack Whitten honoring black visionaries in politics and the arts, many of whom (including Ellison) Whitten knew. To create this mosaic-like painting, Whitten made tiles composed of organic materials and acrylic paint and applied them to a canvas. The tiles each have a unique chemistry, with embedded materials that are symbolic. According to Whitten, the figure’s acrylic-encased razor-blade mouth references the “double edge of black identity,” which “cuts both ways.” The illumination radiating from the figure alludes to one of Whitten’s favorite sentences in Invisible Man: “The truth is the light and the light is the truth.”
 Simon Norfolk’s Israeli Sniper Wall depicts a border zone: a wall built between the Israeli settlement of Gilo, outside Jerusalem, and an adjacent Palestinian village, to protect Israeli settlers from gunfire. To brighten the view on the Israeli side, the wall has been painted with a landscape, the view as it would have been without the Palestinian village on the opposite side. The elegant composition, muted colors, and smooth tonalities of the photograph add to its almost otherworldly character. Norfolk's use of an old-fashioned mahogany and brass field camera—a large-format view camera with a slow shutter speed—also contributes to the epic quality of the image: a beauty in conflict, or at least in jarring juxtaposition, with the problematic subject at hand. Norfolk's extraordinary ability to fuse the timeless and the topical resonates with the Museum’s great collection of landscape paintings steeped in meaning, most notably the “Great Pictures” of the American West, such as Alfred Bierstadt’s A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie (1863).
 In many of his staged photographs, William Wegman uses his dogs in playful and surprising ways. At first glance October 1981, Rangeley, Maine looks like a mere forest, but further inspection reveals a weimaraner camouflaged by the foliage. Wegman’s image mischievously evokes fairy tales, fantasies, and legends, in which the forest has traditionally been used as a backdrop, and the dog emerges from the forest in disguise like a canine Robin Hood.
 Su Xiaobai engages both Western abstraction and the traditional Chinese medium of lacquer in creating this painting, at once translucent and luminous, opaque and furrowed. Su has said that this painting was inspired by Buddhist philosophy and Ming and Qing dynasty blue-and-white porcelains.
 In Liberty, Hank Willis Thomas renders a two-dimensional image as a three-dimensional sculpture. The original photograph appeared in Life Magazine in 1986 and featured a Harlem Globetrotter in front of the Statue of Liberty, spinning a basketball on his finger. Interested in popular culture, photographic history, and sports as a metaphor for individual and collective struggle, Thomas created a lifesize sculpture of the moment by casting the arm of retired NBA All-Star Juwan Howard. Liberty is part of Thomas’s Punctum series, which draws inspiration from the French philosopher Roland Barthes’s idea of the punctum: that “element which rises from the [photographic] scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces.” Using this concept as his foundation, Thomas selects a specific area of an image and re-presents it as sculpture. Through cropping and isolation, he encourages us to contemplate framing itself: what is left in or out of a photograph, narrative, or account of a historical event, and why?
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.

 Painting is about the world that we live in. Black men live in the world. My choice is to include them. This is my way of saying yes to us. -Kehinde Wiley Historically, the role of portraiture has been not only to create a likeness but also to communicate ideas about the subject's status, wealth, and power. During the eighteenth century, for example, major patrons from the church and the aristocracy commissioned portraits in part to signify their importance in society. This portrait imitates the posture of the figure of Napoleon Bonaparte in Jacques-Louis David's painting Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at Grand-Saint-Bernard. Wiley transforms the traditional equestrian portrait by substituting an anonymous young Black man dressed in contemporary clothing for the figure of Napoleon. The artist thereby confronts and critiques historical traditions that do not acknowledge Black cultural experience. Wiley presents a new brand of portraiture that redefines and affirms Black identity and simultaneously questions the history of Western painting.
 Homeless Hungry Homo comments on how gay Africans are . . . oftentimes more likely to end up in poverty because of the dual criminalization and demonization of same-sex love, by the government and the church respectively. It also comments on the fear of poverty as a result of coming out, and the notion that people will choose to remain “masked” and in the closet for that reason.— Adejoke TugbiyeleTragically, the sort of binary-free, autonomous space artists like Jacolby Satterwhite celebrate is not always available, particularly in parts of contemporary Africa. Adejoke Tugbiyele’s art advocates for richer and more humane understandings of identity and status, particularly with regard to sexual orientation.Here, Tugbiyele takes discarded and low-value materials, including palm stems, and weaves them into a figure imbued with the colors of the gay pride flag. At the same time, the figure sits in a gesture that evokes a life lived on the streets and wears a mask to conceal the subject’s identity.
 This cabinet exemplifies the work of Droog, an informal confederation of Dutch designers founded by Gijs Bakker, a product designer, and Renny Ramakers, an art historian. It consists of recycled drawer fronts inserted in newly constructed wooden boxes held together by a commercial cinch strap. Witty yet functional, it may seem to be merely a mélange of used and new furniture parts, but in fact it is a well-considered composition, balanced in both shape and color. The customer is invited to rearrange the parts at will. Droog’s dramatic and sometimes heretical approach challenges accepted ideas of decorum in design and materials.
 Adolescence has become ubiquitous subject matter in contemporary photography. Whether it is the awkwardness of Rineke Dijkstra’s gangly prepubescents or the sexuality, malaise, and dysfunction depicted by Larry Clark, the worlds of adolescents and teenagers seem to have been exhaustively described. While Lise Sarfati continues to mine this rich vein of subject matter, she evokes a slightly different tone. In her first book of photographs, Acta Est, she documented the dark, emotional territory of wayward youth in post-Soviet Russia. Robin, #43, Oakland, CA is from her subsequent project, titled The American Series. Published in book form as The New Life, the series comprises images of young people from Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, and California. Directionless, dispossessed, and dejected, these young people (mainly young women) appear ghost-like and unattached to their surroundings. Sarfati’s subjects transcend their social, political, or cultural categories; as carriers of individual, as well as universal, psychological states, they represent the interstitial space between inertia and movement. In Robin, #43, Oakland, CA, the young woman gazes into a backyard hidden from view. Framed by the intersecting lines of backyard fences bathed in a saturated cyan light, Robin may sit firmly on her home soil, but she is emotionally unmoored from it.
 Louise Bourgeois is celebrated for sculptures and drawings that powerfully abstract and critically engage the female form. Eyes sheds light on the importance of eyes as visual symbols. The third eye, as seen on Kali, has often been associated with supernatural powers in Indian mythology and continues to appear in contemporary imagery. The act of gazing into numerous eyes might also recall the practice of darshan, a dialectical and spiritual way of looking that considers the object as both image and living being, providing an experience of seeing that informs South Asian culture.—CG
 
There is something magical about a reflection in a mirror. It seems to be an accurate record of what it represents, but it is reversed left to right and is subject to manipulation and distortion. Michelangelo Pistoletto plays with the idea of reflection and the merging of art and everyday life in this work.Figures are silkscreened on a piece of reflective stainless steel, creating permanent content for the piece. But as viewers pass in front of it, temporary inhabitants of the space—you—also appear and disappear.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces, such as the "Casablanca" cabinet displayed here, were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 The use of sand to suggest the movement of water is common in traditional Japanese raked sand, or kare sansui, gardens. The most famous example is the sixteenth-century garden of the Zen temple Ryonanji in Kyoto, which in expressing the expanse of the oceans is intended to represent the entire universe. In order to achieve the same effect in his ceramic vessel, Sakiyama constructed the form from three slabs of clay that were carved into the wave pattern. After firing the vase once, he then covered it with a sand-infused glaze and refired it to stoneware temperature.
 Employing the traditional print medium of etching (most often associated with European masters such as Rembrandt), the contemporary African American artist Kara Walker loads images of the Civil War era with grotesque stereotypes and elements of violence and sexuality. By doing so, Walker challenges heroic Civil War narratives and forces the viewer to confront the dishonesty of sanitized accounts of historical race relations.

 The Thunderbolt was one of three classic wooden roller coasters constructed at Coney Island in the 1920s. Built on the Bowery in 1925 above the late nineteenth-century Kensington Hotel, the Thunderbolt was featured in Woody Allen’s film Annie Hall, in which the character Alvy Singer lived in the former hotel under the roller coaster. The Thunderbolt was closed in 1983 and demolished in 2000 together with the house, which was occupied until the end. The site remains empty today, next to the new KeySpan Park. The Tornado, the second of the signature roller coasters, also on the Bowery, burned in 1977, while the third, the Cyclone, has been a New York City Historic Landmark since 1991. KeySpan Park, home of the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team, opened on the site of Steeplechase Park in 2001 and was part of longtime efforts to rejuvenate Coney Island.
 James Turrell’s art centers on the perception of light in architectural spaces. He employed aerial landscape views in works related to his most ambitious site project, an “observatory” within the Roden Crater in Arizona. Turrell chose the site during aerial flyovers in the late 1970s, and since then he has been constructing viewing spaces that admit the natural light of the sun and stars in various ways to create specific perceptual effects. A meeting of science and art, Turrell’s work draws on the power of place, geologic time, and humanity’s long relationship to celestial phenomena.
 New technology often inspires artists to rethink traditional forms and create objects of great originality. In this instance, the designer has worked largely on a computer to realize his design. He began with a birch plywood cube, a modern building material, and two traditional images, of a Baroque table and a bombé chest (a low cabinet with serpentine curves), which he conflated and morphed on his computer. He then divided his design into fifty-seven virtual slices, or cross-sections, and utilizing a computer numerical controlled (CNC) laser, cut the cube from two directions simultaneously to create a silhouette with complex compound curves. The table is composed of 741 layers of birch plywood. It was limited to an edition of twenty that is now sold out.
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”

 By Western standards, modern jewelry making is not widely known in Israel. The few Israeli artists who do create modernist jewelry have often studied abroad and exhibit and sell their designs in Europe. Schocken, who lives in Jerusalem, was trained as an architect in Israel and then went to England to learn jewelry making. Her jewelry is reductivist and abstract and reflects her lifelong passion for modern architecture, in particular Tel Aviv's well-known cache of Bauhaus-inspired buildings from the 1920s and 1930s.

 Lynn Hyman Butler’s Coney Island Kaleidoscope series combats the idea of Coney Island as a time capsule of nostalgia. During a period of crime and political and financial instability, artists such as Butler considered the site’s uncertain fate as a subject for their work. Saturated colors glide through these playful images, taken while Butler was physically in motion, emulating the vision of a visitor in flux on an amusement park ride. The figures in these two photographs stride forward boldly in contemporary attire: sundresses and straw hats, and leather vests with tattooed arms. The vibrant energy and sense of movement and chaos reject sentimentality, alluding to the velocity of time. Butler is interested in conveying the rush of disorder and the change from past to present Coney Island, and aims to signal the need for historic preservation in its future.

 Using square steel plates coated with white baked enamel as the basic module, Jennifer Bartlett explores the fine line between representational and abstract painting. Characteristic of her work during this time, Bartlett used this module technique, basic geometric figures, and primary colors—in this case the triangle and the color red—to reveal the fragile line that separates an abstract symbol from an ordinary object, such as a house or a mountain.
 This young boy, a child laborer, alludes to both the global history of sugar and the contentious history of representation of African and African-descended people. Operating in what Kara Walker calls “the fissure between desire for and revulsion against,” he demonstrates both racist objectification and strange affection. Made of resin and coated in sugar, he highlights the impact of the triangular trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas, and the enslaved people who were the foundation of the sugar industry and of European and American economies from the sixteenth century on. This figure is a permanent version of an attendant from Walker’s installation A Subtlety, a public project at the Domino Sugar Refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2014.
 In some regions of Ghana, it is typical for the shape and style of a coffin to make a personal statement by reflecting the profession, interests, or characteristics of the deceased. The mother of many children might have a coffin in the shape of a hen with chicks. In this case, it is a Nike sneaker, a symbol of status and modernity in the late twentieth century. As people make the transition from one world to the unknown next, an object (a coffin) representing another object (in this case, a shoe) provides comforting familiarity.
 This relief was once brightly painted, as was most temple decoration. Unlike most temple reliefs, however, it was partially inlaid. The corpulent figures, labeled as bodies of water, were part of a procession of geographical personifications conveying the idea of parts of Egypt showing their submission and bringing their bounty  to the temple.
 This work is inspired by Gary Simmons’s ongoing exploration of sports, history, race, and class in American popular culture. It is based on the tragic events surrounding a nationally televised boxing match at Madison Square Garden on March 24, 1962. Emile Griffith and Benny Paret, immigrants from Saint Thomas and Cuba, respectively, battled for the welterweight title. Paret was gravely hurt and died from his injuries ten days later. Vintage fight posters, with the two fighters’ names clearly visible, make up the background of Convention Hall. Two ghostly falling stars, portraits of sorts, perhaps allude to the hardships both men experienced, in and out of the ring.
 Coming to Detroit at an early age, Harry Bertoia first learned jewelry making and later studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he remained after graduation to head the metalworking department. Bertoia created large-scale public-sculpture commissions as well as small-scale decorative pieces such as Bush, which demonstrates his early training in jewelry and fine metalworking. Although abstract, Bush evokes an underwater creature or a dandelion plant that has lost its fuzzy spores.
 Dotty Attie often appropriates historical works of art by male artists to demonstrate gender inequalities within the art world. Barred from the Studio is part of her late 1980s series Episodes from the Lives of the Masters. Here Attie adapts two famous works by the American painter Thomas Eakins, Max Schmitt in a Single Scull, 1871, and The Gross Clinic, 1875. Her text documents the uproar caused when Eakins, a professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, allowed female students to attend life classes with nude male models. She points out the hypocrisy of Victorian society, which took offense at not only the frank representation of a surgeon’s bloodied hands, but also the idea of women observing and understanding male anatomy.
 Hellen van Meene’s photograph is an illuminating example of this young Dutch photographer’s practice of portraiture. The young woman looks away from the viewer, her body contorted, as if frozen in a movement to shield herself from invading gazes. Light streams through a window from outside the picture, falling softly on her pale skin. It highlights not only her dyed blond hair but also her shoulder blade, oddly jutting out, unsettling the contour and emphasizing her thin frame. The partial shadow reveals the texture of the skin, including goose pimples and the deep impression of a bra. Like her fellow Dutch portraitist Rineke Dijkstra, van Meene focuses on transitional states, usually, in van Meene's case, the pubescent girl, her vulnerability and doubts, poised somewhere between childhood and womanhood. As with many of van Meene's subjects, this adolescent has been posed by the artist to play a role. Interested in the dramatic potential of portraiture, in the tradition of artists such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Claude Cahun, van Meene does not intend to objectively document her subjects nor to catch their personalities, but rather, with the help of her models, to create a certain mood. Selecting subjects among young people she knows in her neighborhood as well as teenagers she meets on the street when traveling, van Meene carefully stages her pictures. Usually set in a shallow space, close to the picture plane, the models are prepared down to the smallest detail: make-up; wardrobe, if any; the pose; the direction of the gaze. And in this case, the little flower that just makes it into the picture in the lower right corner.
 Alison Elizabeth Taylor’s Security House examines the contemporary landscape and culture of the southwestern United States. She uses marquetry, a woodworking technique dating from the Renaissance, to depict a dilapidated tract house amid an unkempt yard. Selecting wood veneers in a variety of grains and earthy desert tones, she embellishes the scene with details that suggest narratives relating to housing foreclosures and fears about border security. Security House taps into a long-standing romance with the American frontier, while also suggesting the persistence of boom-and-bust cycles that have historically characterized towns in the West.
 
 Photographed in a studio against a neutral background, Andres Serrano’s portrait shows a Navajo woman in traditional dress. While the photograph’s large scale monumentalizes the subject, Serrano depicts his sitter in a direct and dignified manner, producing a sense of engaging intimacy. Serrano has explored fundamental issues related to sex, religion, race, and prejudice throughout his career. Whatever his subject matter, he always considers himself a portraitist. He has often expressed his admiration of both August Sander, the 1920s chronicler of people in various segments of German society, and Edward S. Curtis, who in the early twentieth century aimed at documenting the disappearance of traditional life among the indigenous peoples of North America. Curtis has been criticized for fabricating a false reality, staging scenes and retouching his photographs to conform to a stereotypical idea of traditional Native culture. To Serrano, however, it is the sense of dignity in Curtis’s depictions that matters, and this quality comes through in his own portrait of Lyndell Yazzie.

Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Leon Polk Smith was born in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) a century ago. After receiving a Masters in Art Education at Columbia University in 1938, he had his first one-person exhibition in 1941. Since then his work has been featured in countless exhibitions worldwide.An admirer of the abstract paintings of Piet Mondrian, Smith decided early in his career to dispense with the recognizable object as part of his paintings. In the mid-1940s he began painting abstract compositions based on the relationships of basic geometric elements, which he gradually reduced to a minimum.Jubilee, one of Smith's late works, is an extreme example of this economy of means. The four lines seem to move across the canvas, suggesting spatial relationships and depth of field. The painting illustrates well a statement of the artist's creative principles that he wrote in 1961: "Three elements which interested me in art are line, color, and the concept of space and its use as a positive force."
 This flamboyant necklace is typical of the decorative projects of Rhonda Zwillinger, who is also a well-known avant-garde photographer and was a leading artist in the emergence of New York's East Village as a vital center of contemporary art in the 1980s. Using inexpensive plastic sequins and beads, Zwillinger embellishes her jewelry, everyday objects such as found handbags, and entire room installations to astonishing effect. This necklace, which the artist describes as "wearable ecstasy" sold for $125 at the Gracie Mansion Gallery in the East Village in 1987.
 ART OF BELIEFEach of these works is the product of a religious tradition that synthesized and adapted new beliefs and art forms to existing faith systems. Both objects are testaments to the long-standing global nature of African religions, ideas, and art. The stone sculpture represents Serapis, a composite god created early in the Ptolemaic (Greek) rule of Egypt to unite Greeks and Egyptians. The deity combined aspects of Egyptian gods (especially Osiris, the ruler of the Underworld) with Greek deities (particularly Zeus, the king of the gods). Worship of Serapis continued in the Roman period and eventually spread to Europe. The painting depicts al-Buraq, the winged horse with a woman's head on which the prophet Muhammad flew the mi'raj, his nocturnal journey to heaven to meet God. Like many in Senegal, Gora Mbengue was a member of a Sufi order, a group dedicated to the practice of a mystical interpretation of Islam. Sufism played an important role in the spread of Islam in West Africa, inspiring schools and movements particularly open to melding new and existing systems of belief and image making. Reverse glass painting (souwère) developed by 1900 in Senegal's cities, as pilgrims on the hajj to Mecca brought the technique back from the eastern Mediterranean.
 As she has done in the past, Nina Abney here creates a highly personal, imaginative, and eclectic interpretation of a literary source. Forbidden Fruit, part of a series inspired by Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, alludes to the chapter featuring a hookah-puffing caterpillar. According to the artist, the composition of the figures and the choice of light blue and green were drawn from Henri Matisse’s 1909 painting The Dance. Sea-Monkeys (a species of brine shrimp sold as curiosities during the artist’s childhood) provided the model for the two figures with antennae sitting on the left, and the numbers that appear on various figures also have personal meaning for Abney. Though the original Alice is absent here, Abney’s boldly hued hallucinatory scene populated by fantastic creatures vividly simulates the magical environment of the text, in which Alice experiments with mushrooms that allow her to grow and shrink in size.
 ART OF WRITINGBoth of these works, separated by many centuries, use the human body as a platform for expressing and displaying script. Shabtis are funerary figures intended to do the agricultural work the gods might require of the deceased, represented here holding hoes. The hieroglyphic inscription on this figure is a spell from the Book of the Dead, asking the shabti to do the Nubian king Senkamanisken’s work for him in the afterlife. Owusu-Ankomah's paintings depict a spiritual world occupied by people and symbols. The male figure in this work is covered by, and moves within, Akan adinkra symbols from the artist's native Ghana, each of which graphically represents a particular concept or proverb. Looking Back Into the Future depicts a nude man with his head turned backward, in a pose associated with the Akan proverbial concept of sankofa ("one must know the past to know the future"). You can see a contemporary version of adinkra cloth among the "touch" textiles around the corner.
 ART OF PORTRAITSWhile Western artists have historically often attempted to represent a person exactly how they look, many African artists instead have created portraits based on a specific physical or personality feature of the subject. This terracotta head, most likely depicting the oni, or king, of ancient Ife, shows that Yoruba sculpture was already highly developed a thousand years ago. Ife court art interprets the human figure with extraordinary naturalism. This head, however, is not intended to be truly representational or realistic. It shows the oni in the prime of life, with no imperfections. Fiegnon is composed chiefly of a discarded oil jerry can. Although Fiegnon may appear to resemble a mask, Romuald Hazoumé has noted that his works are, in fact, portraits—of particular individuals or of social types. With its long braids, this work represents a Fulani man Hazoumé met fishing in the lagoon where he found the oilcan. The striking differences in style and materials in these two portraits may also reflect a marked gap in status and power between their two subjects.
Kaneta Masanao forms his pieces using the kurinuki technique, which involves scooping, pinching, and scraping a block of clay into the desired shape. Like many other Japanese studio potters, Masanao sees a close link between sculpture and ceramic art.
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 ART OF DESIGNAfrican artists have a long history of responding to fresh design concepts, while always revising them to ends both practical and novel. Together, these three works trace the evolution of a single form: first, as an imported idea became African, and then as contemporary artists adapted this African form for a global market. Most seats in sub-Saharan Africa are low stools, carved from a single block of wood. Yet, as early as the sixteenth century, Portuguese traders and explorers introduced chairs with backs to southern and eastern Africa. Chokwe artists soon began to produce similar chairs, adding sculptural scenes and Chokwe motifs. This wood chair was carved as an object of status for a chief. In fact, none of these three chairs were meant for sitting. Gonçalo Mabunda's Harmony chair uses decommissioned handguns, bullet belts, and other munitions collected from the estimated 7 million weapons left in Mozambique following the end of its civil war in 1992. Its design references a coastal East African tradition of high-backed chairs that were symbols of power and prestige, discussion and debate. The Sansa chair, an inventive deconstruction of the chair form, is among the original creations that have established Cheick Diallo as one of Africa's leading contemporary designers. Built at Diallo's direction by artisans from Bamako, the half-reclining Sansa chair seems to sit midway between a European notion of the chair as a leisure object and a West African idea of the chair as a support for displaying a person of status.

 Music played an important role in Romare Bearden's art. He especially loved jazz, and his method as a visual artist was based in part on what he had learned from jazz musicians about improvisation. As in jazz, the unpredictable repetitions and juxtapositions of shapes, textures, and colors in his art create startling, unexpected visual rhythms. As Bearden once said about being an artist: "You must become a blues singer—only you sing on the canvas. You improvise—you find the rhythm and catch it good, and structure as you go along—then the song is you. Music has always been important for me the way it has been important for many Blacks. Blacks have made their own sound, their own musical language like jazz. It is theirs and they identify with it. In a world of constantly changing identities, certain forms of music represent a solid identity for Blacks."
 Shooting primarily in the United States and the Caribbean, Deana Lawson is inspired by the expression and aesthetics of black cultures worldwide. Using a large-format camera, and working across a variety of photographic traditions—including portraiture, staged scenes, found or appropriated imagery, and vernacular photography such as family albums—she addresses themes of the body, sensuality, community, and spirituality, among others. Lawson’s photographs can be seen as psychological portraits of black subjects in an extended, mythological diasporic family.
 Since the early 1990s, Nick Cave has been fabricating inventive sculptures out of scavenged materials, which he often overlays with beadwork, stitching, and other embellishments. One of the first, crafted from twigs, was made to be worn and created a rustling sound, which led to the eventual name of such works: Soundsuits. Cave’s costumes draw from a variety of sources, including both African and Caribbean traditions of masquerade.In performance, Cave’s work invokes moments of whimsical transcendence—but a very real, grounded, and nuanced understanding of the racialized nature of American society is often just underneath. Overcoming the distinctions between “fine art” and “craft,” as well as “performance” and “street” art, Cave’s Soundsuits may also serve as a sort of armor, protecting against the violence of racial stereotypes and giving their wearers an outsize, fanciful, and transcendent presence. Cave designed his first Soundsuit in response to the brutal police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1992.Cave’s costumes enable performers to be seen free from the constraints of being placed in categories, and to be free to transform their environment into an otherworldly space.
 In the ongoing series Sunday Paintings, Byron Kim inscribes personal notes about his daily life onto his painted images of the sky. In nuanced hues of blue, each of the six examples shown here represents the sky on the Sunday it was painted. The words sit on the picture plane, creating a play between the painting as a flat surface and as a window opening onto the illusion of deep space. Lined up on a wall, the Sunday Paintings have a cinematic quality: each panel looks like a frame in a film sequence—a moment in time stilled—as if each is a part of a larger ongoing whole. While the works were created on Sundays, the title of this series also refers to amateurs known as “Sunday painters,” admired by Kim for the purity of their motives in making art.

 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA.

Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 Sol LeWitt, active from the 1960s, was a pioneer of Minimalism and Conceptual art. He often worked with simple geometric forms—particularly the cube—straight lines, and ninety-degree angles. Hanging Structure’s suspended three-dimensional grid, composed of identical, monochromatic units, is emblematic of this interest. In contrast, Terence Koh, inspired by queer, punk, and DIY cultures, belongs to a 1990s generation whose work is more personally inflected. Embracing decay and ephemerality, Untitled (Vitrines) displays whitewashed objects collected from friends, lovers, Koh’s childhood, and flea markets, acting almost as a shrine preserving relics from his life. The sculpture departs significantly from LeWitt’s strict vision yet engages with the legacies of Minimalism and Conceptual art, exploring the possibilities of the grid and the monochrome and extending those formal considerations into the personal realm.
 ART OF IDEASAfrican art is conceptual art. In both form and use, it reveals sophisticated systems of knowledge, but rarely directly. These two seemingly unrelated works express hidden and poignant ideas about security and liberty. An nkisi nkondi embodies defensive power and was used to protect a community. To complete this sculpture, a ritual expert placed potent ingredients associated with supernatural powers in the cavity carved into the figure’s abdomen. Nails and blades activated the spirit that was now accessible through the figure. This nkisi's pose, with hands on hips, symbolizes its readiness to defend the righteous and to destroy enemies. In Viyé Diba's work, the piece of painted yellow wood, projecting between the seams of the woven canvas, and the abstract forms that suggest fleeing figures at the top evoke the possibility of liberation—from the literal plane of the canvas, from the strictures of painting and sculpture, or, perhaps, from the history of the city of Dakar itself, the site of a former way station in the trade of human captives. Diba's art is composed entirely of materials he found walking around Dakar.
 This fragment from one of the stained-glass windows that Henry E. Sharp designed for the Church of St. Ann's in Brooklyn Heights in 1867–69 illustrates the artist's decorating technique. Some of the elements in his windows were solid pieces of colored glass; others were pieces of colorless glass overlaid, or flashed, with a thin layer of colored glass–in this case, dark blue. The colored glass was coated with a vitreous black paint, a stencil was placed over the paint, and a craftsman scratched away the black to reveal the design. The glass pieces were then fired in a kiln to fix the black color. Over time, the black paint slowly faded, as can be seen in the pale yellow ground of the complete window by Sharp displayed here. The more intense black seen in the window's three central medallions and blue, red, and green borders is the result of recent conservation. Colorless glass was placed on the back of the faded pieces, and the original design was repainted in black on the new glass.
 Walton Ford draws his inspiration from the work of such artists as the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century fantasy painter Hieronymus Bosch, the nineteenth-century naturalist John James Audubon, and the nineteenth-century French caricaturist J. J. Grandville, whose parthuman, part-animal subjects satirize man’s shortcomings. Although very different from Ford’s more recent watercolors, these four early oil paintings, a series of family portraits where the image is complicated and turned grotesque by the juxtaposition of repulsive elements close to the sitter’s face, hint at the artist’s continuing interest in the association of man and animal. Ford often explores this interest in relation to the history of colonialism, nineteenth-century industrialism, or contemporary politics.

 Green Hands and Faces is from a powerful group of paintings by Ross Bleckner that take on a subject of importance to the artist since the 1980s—the loss of friends and loved ones to AIDS. Each luminous spot on the canvas's surface stands metaphorically as a glowing flame, a flickering symbol of a deceased person whose life remains as a memory. As if created by a source emanating from the depth of darkness, the "hands" and "faces" are the result of fine modulation of reflective oil paint and varnish.
 Incorporating a well-worn wooden table and a misshapen ceramic bowl, Jessica Jackson Hutchins’s Kitchen Table Allegory uses design objects to create a sculpture that evokes the private world of the home. The table served Hutchins and her family until she decided to use it as the plate for a series of prints that were initially presented with the sculpture. Personal without devolving into the confessional, the work situates the source of creative inspiration within the familial and the everyday.
 A Composition for Detroit is a portrait of contemporary America. Inspired by many trips to Detroit and its banks of broken factory windows, some overpainted, Sara VanDerBeek built structures that functioned as supports for leaning panes of glass and a wide range of photographic imagery. She then photographed her ephemeral installations before dismantling them. The photographic material includes close-ups of images such as, in the first panel, a Walker Evans photograph of the ruins of a pre–Civil War plantation in Louisiana and a Charles Moore picture of a crouching woman, sprayed with water, during a 1963 civil rights protest. VanDerBeek also used documentary material, some dealing with riots in Detroit in 1967, as well as her own evocative photographs of abandoned buildings and broken blinds. The photographs contribute to the subtle telling of stories that move from left to right across the four panels, or from back to front within each panel. According to the artist, the allusions to windows, stairs, and doorways in all the panels open up the possibility of either staying where we are or taking off in new directions.
 “It was my first self-assigned art project at twenty years of age,” Stephen Salmieri says of his Coney Island series, “My instincts knew better than I did.” The artist’s feelings of spontaneity and independence are echoed in this photograph of four boys with fishing rods in hand perched atop jagged boulders and surrounded by waves. Here, Salmieri underscores the sense of exploration and adventure that Coney Island provides to young people who crave a break from the city.

 This work by the Salish, French-Cree, and Shoshone artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith explores the challenges of Native American coexistence with American culture. The Plains woman’s dress featured prominently in the painting is worn by those in the Ghost Dance Religion to recall the vision of John Wilson (better known as Wovoka), who prophesied that white people would vanish and Native Americans would return to take back the land that was once theirs. The religious movement offered hope to many homeless, ill, and hungry Native Americans, and its message and surrounding tensions are, according to the artist, conveyed through various elements in this work: the eagle appears as a messenger of the prophecy; bingo cards are meant to represent the Catholic Church’s introduction of gambling to reservations; and written texts convey the “Queen of Hearts” children’s rhyme, a reference to power.
 Conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth reproduces a quotation from Austrian-born Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations, published in 1953. That volume, composed of 693 numbered paragraphs, examines the topic of language and its ability to create meaning. Wittgenstein’s text questions our perception of blueness; Kosuth responds in a sense by representing that text in glowing blue neon, as part of his own ongoing investigation into the elusive relationship between words, things, and their visual representation.
 Kiki Smith’s Annunciation continues the artist’s long exploration of monumental sculptures of women that examine both the physical and psychological aspects of the body within a feminist context. The figure, with its suit and bald head, is gender-neutral. Its oversize head, delicate features, and dangling feet convey a sense of vulnerability, while its upraised eyes and outstretched arm suggest engagement in a rich inner life. Drawing upon her Catholic upbringing, Smith uses the Annunciation—the angel Gabriel’s revelation to the Virgin Mary that she will conceive Jesus—as a metaphor for the moment of creative inspiration.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Kara Walker subverts the original function of nineteenth-century cut-paper silhouettes, initially used for portraits of socially prominent individuals. She reinterprets the medium to create intense explorations of relationships based on power. Here, working in cut steel, Walker includes stereotypical Civil War imagery of the South—a stately plantation mansion, small huts, enslaved African Americans, Confederate soldiers, and Southern belles. As she explores stereotypes, Walker offers no resolution, and her presentation includes neither villains nor heroes. This “play set” even seems to suggest that the cast of characters and their settings could be reorganized, creating new narratives that revolve around issues of oppression and power, race and gender, and moral ambiguity.
 The Half Moon Hotel opened on the boardwalk in 1927. Its name referred to the explorer Henry Hudson’s ship, which anchored off Gravesend Bay on Coney Island in 1609 before continuing toward what would be called Manhattan and the Hudson River. Initially fashionable and well attended, the hotel suffered from the general decline and became a maternity hospital in the late 1940s. A senior citizens’ home was built on the site in the 1970s. This ghostlike image by John L. Murphy captures the memory of time past at Coney Island. Filled with both sadness and nostalgia, it conflates many layers of the site’s history.
 Becoming AgainMasquerade is a moment for play—a chance to invent and experiment, even within established social needs and existing mask genres. These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.The two Bobo works share a basic form—a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns—typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.The Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.
 In his short life, the artist Michael Richards often created work related to the struggles and triumphs of African Americans. He spent nearly ten years, for example, on a series of sculptures dedicated to the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black aviators—named for their base in Tuskegee, Alabama—who during World War II became the first African American military pilots in the history of the United States. For this particular sculpture, as with others in the series, Richards made a fiberglass mold of his own body and then pierced the work with nails (other sculptures in the series are impaled by toy airplanes). The sculpture thus refers both to Christian iconography (St. Sebastian, depicted with a body full of arrows) and to African objects known as nkisi nkondi.In a tragic and eerie twist of fate, Michael Richards was working as an artist-In-residence with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council at its studios in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001, and died in the attack on Tower 1. He did not live to witness the surviving Tuskegee Airmen receive the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal, on March 29, 2007.
 Yuji Agematsu has been transforming the raw material of life into art for nearly thirty years. In the Zip series, an array of objects—collected during the artist’s daily walks through New York City—are displayed on shelves, with each unit of shelves representing a month’s collecting. The pieces are both a record of his wanderings and a repository for the residue of our collective consumption. Collector, curator, and archivist, he states: “I walk around the city during the night too. The empty streets have a feeling akin to a beach when the tide is low. The objects are left where both big and small waves of the consumerist society have ebbed; people call them rubbish, waste, trash, and so on, which nevertheless talk to me, even eloquently at times.”

 At the forefront of the African-American avant-garde in Los Angeles and New York in the 1960s and 1970s, Senga Nengudi was first recognized for her anthropomorphic nylon mesh sculptures, such as Inside/Outside. The bulbous stockings twist and strain under the weight of the sand they contain, calling to mind both the rhythm of a swinging pendulum and exposed internal organs. The work also conjures the image of a traditional African headdress, telling of Nengudi’s interest in African philosophy and ritual. The artist’s background as a dancer and choreographer informs her practice, and she has often utilized works such as Inside/Outside in her own performances, testing the limit of her constructions by wearing and stretching the nylons to the brink of bursting.
 In 2005, Mary Coble staged a twelve-hour endurance performance titled Note to Self, in which she had the first names of 438 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender victims of hate-crime murders tattooed over her entire body without ink. Vivid evidence of Coble’s harrowing artistic process appears in this photograph. As the fresh needle punctures imprinted names on her lower leg, the artist’s blood mingled with an older ink tattoo, a rainbow-hued chain of figures emblematic of a diverse community. This documentary photograph shows Coble’s body as a locus for reflection on both the physical nature of assaults inflicted on hate-crime victims and the reporting of their deaths. The artist’s preparatory research revealed that anti-gay words were carved into some of the victims’ skin. She also discovered that no centralized database exists for hatecrime statistics, since individual states are not required to report hate-crime deaths to the FBI or any other federal agency.
 Fred Wilson often appropriates art objects to explore issues of race, gender, class, politics, and aesthetics. Made up of five portrait heads of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, Grey Area (Brown Version) refers to one of the most copied works of ancient civilization. The otherwise identical plaster effigies, which he purchased and painted, illustrate a value scale ranging in color from oatmeal to dark chocolate. Thus, Wilson raises, but does not answer, controversial questions about the racial identity of ancient Egyptians. In both his provocative, groundbreaking installations in cultural institutions and in his studio work, Wilson encourages viewers to recognize how changes in context create changes in meaning. He has said of his practice, “I use beauty as a way of helping people to receive difficult or upsetting ideas. The topical issues are merely a vehicle for making one aware of one’s own perceptual shift—which is the real thrill.”
 Mickalene Thomas creates monumental pictures that explore and challenge the representation and objectification of women, and black women in particular. She draws inspiration from images of iconic African American women, emblems of the Black Power Movement, and her mother’s photographs from the 1970s. Here, she casts an African American woman as leading lady in an updated version of an established visual archetype—a sexualized female subject seemingly caught unaware as she reclines passively in her own beauty. In doing so, the artist turns the historic nude on its head and ousts the white European woman from the bed where she often lounges, attended by a black maidservant, in Western art.
 Hew Locke constructed Koh-i-noor, one of three monumental portraits of Queen Elizabeth, out of hundreds of kitschy plastic toys and trinkets, disposable products of the new global economy. The bristling blades of toy sabers suggest might and power. With this work, Locke, who was born in Britain and raised in Guyana, explores tensions between contemporary British society and its colonial past. The title refers to the Koh-i-noor diamond, a legendary treasure dating back to fourteenth-century India. Once the largest diamond in the world, it passed through the hands of Sikh, Mughal, and Persian rulers as a highly prized spoil of war. In 1877 the British government declared Queen Victoria the Empress of India, and the diamond entered the British Crown Jewels collection.
 BM (3Fb) is part of Luis Mallo’s Open Secrets, a recent group of photographs taken in museums in New York City and elsewhere. The series focuses on storage areas and reveals hidden spaces not typically accessible to the public. This image, from the Brooklyn Museum, shows storage for sculptures whose identity in most cases is partially obscured by protective wrapping. The photographer’s careful composition represents only a fragment of a larger whole, revealing the beauty within the more or less organized structure of museum storage while not decoding the system itself. Mallo does not stage or rearrange any items, and his mostly straightforward composition aspires to an objective viewpoint. The combination of sometimes random objects, however, creates a sense of mystery and reminds us that collections are not always easy to classify.

 Norman Mizuno began making jewelry as a child in his native Hawaii, helping his mother fashion pieces from tropical seeds and nuts for the tourist trade. According to the artist, the beads that constitute this necklace, which he terms "clay body jewelry," were made between 1972 and 1980 and then reconfigured in 1990. Mizuno cites a wide variety of influences, from ancient Egyptian and Mayan artifacts to Las Vegas showgirl costumes.
 Matsubayashi Yukoan, who is based in Uji, Kyoto, works in the subtle gohonde style of Asahi ware, a centuries-old specialty of the Matsubayashi family. This work, which was designed expressly for the Museum collection, has the superb coloration referred to as higawari ("changing in the fire"), a result of the interaction between kiln structure, pine fuel, and a special clay called kase.
 The motif of "three friends" popular in East Asian literary culture is here presented as a repeated stylized shōchikubai (pine, plum, and bamboo) pattern carved in a diagonal rectangular grid.
 Modern Artists and Ancient EgyptLorraine O’Grady uses ancient Egyptian art to explore contemporary issues. Artists from many times and places have been inspired by the heritage of ancient Egypt to make new works that speak to their own time. Displaying works like this within the Egyptian Galleries allows visitors to participate in the ongoing dialogue that artists have pursued with the ancients, as they have expressed their stake in ancient history and its continuing relevance. Lorraine O’Grady’s photographs grew out of a 1980 performance called Nefertiti/Devonia Evangeline, which took place in front of a series of projected images similar to the ones seen here. The work examined the troubled relationship between O’Grady and her deceased sister, Devonia Evangeline, through juxtaposed portraits of the Egyptian queens Nefertiti and Mutnedjmet, of a later reign, proposed by some scholars to be Nefertiti’s sister. Though the subject matter is deeply personal, it allows O’Grady to address issues of class, racism, ethnography, and African American art. Thus, as the artist says, her work attempts to “make the historic personal and the personal historic.”
 Wendell Castle, one of America’s most important contemporary furniture makers, has had several distinct stylistic phases in his career. At first he employed both exotic and native American woods to produce furniture characterized by biomorphic forms and attenuated surrealism. By the 1960s, he had begun experimenting with plastic and fiberglass to create seamless organic designs. In the 1980s, he became fascinated with Post-Modernism and produced highly architectural, polychromatic designs. In 2007 he received the Brooklyn Museum/Modernism Lifetime Achievement Award. The Nirvana chair was a gift of the artist in acknowledgment of the Museum’s ongoing commitment to his work.
 Kehinde Wiley presents large-scale portraits of young black men as saints and angels, in poses inspired by paintings from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In creating these monumental paintings, Wiley borrows poses, imagery, and titles from works by master painters such as Tiepolo (1727–1804). Dressed in their everyday clothes, the figures float over flat, brightly colored backgrounds suggestive of infinite space. By placing these "new" subjects within the context of art history, Wiley challenges the prevailing representations of black men in contemporary American society.
 Jules de Balincourt’s monumental painting Not Yet Titled continues a tradition of portraying dramatic landscapes that characterized the Hudson River School of painters. Unlike his predecessors, whose elaborate studio canvases drew on specific details of actual sites, here de Balincourt favors a generic touristic landscape with a steep waterfall that empties into a body of water ringed by palm trees. Tiny figures in boats enhance the atmosphere of leisure-time pleasure, which is set against the forces of nature. Utilizing a flat, painterly, almost intentionally naïve technique of painting, de Balincourt can be regarded as part of a general revival of painting that began to occur in the early twenty-first century. The acquisition of Not Yet Titled will initiate an intriguing dialogue between contemporary practice and the distinguished nineteenth-century American landscape paintings in the collection. Born in France and educated in the United States, de Balincourt is based in Brooklyn.
 George Bradford Brainerd’s photograph of Fourth Avenue, close to the southern edge of Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood, shows the low-cost dwellings lining the street in the late nineteenth century. Crowded tenement buildings replaced the shanties about 1900, and until recently the wide and heavily trafficked avenue retained much of its neglected character. Over the last few years, however, gentrification reached this lower section of Park Slope, and the old tenement buildings are now being razed or upgraded to make space for more expensive housing.Further south, Red Hook is undergoing a similar transformation. With easy access to the open sea, Red Hook became a busy industrial area in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, dominated by the activities of the port and inexpensive housing for workers of local businesses. By the time of Lynn Saville’s photograph in the late 1990s, however, many of the industrial structures had long been abandoned and artists and artisans were occupying the former warehouses. The demolition earlier this year of the sugar refinery in the background of Saville’s picture signals the definite turn of the neighborhood in a new direction. An explosion of residential and retail construction and a recently inaugurated cruise-ship terminal are examples of the contentious redevelopment of the area.
Native American artists Marcellus and Elizabeth Toya Medina and Kevin Pourier create works inspired by both old and new art forms. The painted designs on the water jar of classic Pueblo shape combine traditional masked Kachinas in static poses with naturalistic, muscled, male Pueblo dancers who seem to burst off the vessel’s surface. The inlaid buffalo-horn spoon, a traditional Plains implement, is given a contemporary twist in Pourier’s homage to M. C. Escher’s hypnotic prints.
 In Shack, Elizabeth Murray takes apart the structure of a house, simultaneously showing its interior and exterior, the cobblestone path leading to it, and a window through which the sun is visible. Although her art usually grows out of everyday experiences, she made this print after one of her paintings, working from a Polaroid image. Irregularly shaped, with overlapping planes and elements that project from the surface, Shack explores the creative possibilities in transferring a work from canvas, and pushes the boundaries of printmaking, while maintaining the artist’s signature cartoon-like style.
 For Lydia Buzio the forms of traditional vessels are the starting point for an untraditional treatment that employs contemporary aesthetics and techniques. After the basic shape is selected, the artist draws urban scenes, frequently based on New York cityscapes, on the unfired clay. Each vessel is a work in progress as the artist reevaluates the results and develops the piece by adding color and detail with pigmented slips. She burnishes the surface carefully before firing and then waxes it lightly.
 George Segal was an innovator in sculpture known for his installations of white plaster figures with ghostly appearances. He depicted the dignity in everyday life, showing people poised at a bus stop, paused before a traffic intersection, or conversing on a park bench. Segal's work also took on political themes such as the Holocaust and gay pride. At the time this sculpture was created, the artist discussed its art historical references: "The chair is like a ladder with steps, the box is like a house, the girl is like a Greek caryatid holding up the roof . . . I've always liked the hardness and softness combined, this wedding of organic and geometric."
 
 Sitting directly on the floor, like a Minimalist sculpture, Mitumba Deity consists of lumpy bundles of fabric, stuffed toys, and articles of clothing. Composed of Smith’s own garments and those of friends, the piece alludes to the global economy through the path of secondhand clothing. The piece was inspired by a film that tracks a T-shirt with a university logo from a thrift shop in New York to a mountain village in Africa, where it is purchased by a man and becomes his second shirt. Mitumba is a Swahili word that literally means “bundles” and refers to the packages and articles of used clothing donated by people in prosperous countries to charitable causes. Mitumba Deity is from Smith’s series of bundle sculptures.
 Combining a Minimalist-inspired aesthetic with a love of ordinary materials such as drinking straws, pencils, adhesive tape, and paper plates, Donovan creates delicate but monumental sculptures that evoke forms found in nature. To compose this work, she rolled sheets of Mylar to form cones and then glued these smaller units together to create molecular modules. Characteristically, Donovan exploits the properties of her material—in this case, the reflective surface of Mylar, which responds to light in different ways.
 In this piece, spelled out in sparkling coal crystals are the words “something in me wondered ‘What will happen to all that beauty?’” This quotation from a 1962 essay by James Baldwin (reprinted the following year in the volume The Fire Next Time) is set over a blurred black-and-white image from the Million Man March, a gathering of black social activists in Washington, D.C., in 1995. The accumulation of crystals suggests the mass of participants in this historical event as viewed from above, while the juxtaposition of Baldwin’s text and the image of the march—cultural events separated by over three decades—reminds us of the still-ongoing dialogue about race in America.
 Snoop Dogg is part of Andres Serrano's series America. It attempts to document the current social reality of the U.S.A. In addition to Snoop Dogg, the series includes images of such diverse personalities as a Playboy Bunny, a homeless man, a firefighter, a street vendor, a boy scout, and an assistant at an investment bank. Undertaking the series in response to the shock of 9/11, Serrano set out to answer the question of who we are and what the diversity of America actually looks like. He captures the humanity of his subjects while at the same time the scale of the figures, as they are positioned within the picture frame, gives them almost heroic proportions.
 In this drawing each Lakota woman wears elaborate regalia and carries a fan and a pouch, items used to decorate and honor horses. Warriors and horses in battle are depicted on their clothing. According to the artist, Horse Nation “honors ‘tasunka wakan’ (the horse) for its importance for the Lakota People. The horse allowed them to increase their mobility for hunting, expand their territory, strengthen their ‘akicita’ (protective warrior societies), improve their economy, relieve their burdens, and, most importantly, gave women someone else to love.”
 The New York artist JoAnne Carson’s Bouquet is a big, fantastic representation of a floral arrangement. Its stems are assembled from copper, fiberglass, and resin, bolted to a base of steel, while the individual flowers and leaves are made from thermoplastic, which becomes stiff when dry. Despite the rigidity of the materials, the overall effect is one of fragile beauty, heightened by the delicate turquoise and purple-blue color of the blooms. With its mixture of recognizable and imaginary flowers, this very decorative, oversize piece conveys a sense of otherworldly fantasy.
 Always interested in changing identities, Cindy Sherman consistently acts as her own model. Her photographs depict female characters and usually imply a narrative outside of the picture frame. Sherman’s visual vocabulary is shaped by American culture, and her characters are inspired by types from film, fashion, television, and advertising. The photographs in this group portray women outside of the domestic sphere, distant from traditional female roles as mothers and wives. Untitled Film Still #38 shows a woman cautiously wading into a stream, her posture suggesting that this excursion has a purpose, a goal to be reached within the story. The blurred composition is the result of Sherman’s first experimentation with a heavy telephoto lens, which weighed the camera down on the tripod and altered the focus. Sherman welcomes this element of chance in her work.
 
 Shown in 1972 at the De Luxe Black Arts Center in Houston, one of the first U.S. exhibition spaces to place the work of artists of color alongside that of their white peers, Power Flight takes an experimental approach to painting, moving it off the wall and into three-dimensional space. Freed from the confines of a stretcher, the canvas, composed of five connected triangles, is pulled taut by ropes. The resulting shape suggests nomadic shelters, easily assembled and disassembled by individuals fleeing harm. Using the colors of the Pan-African flag, Joe Overstreet connects metaphors of flight and nomadism to transnational struggles for black liberation.Committed to both experimental art-making and socio-political engagement, the artist notes that his life and work have been "tied up in abstract shape with what black [people] have felt and struggled." In 1973 he and his wife founded Kenkeleba House, a New York gallery focused on artists underrepresented by mainstream institutions.
 Petah Coyne’s fantastical forms, presenting a beauty that slides into the grotesque, allude to death and decay. Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculpturesproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works—the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.Coyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.

 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.

 C. C. Wang, a renowned scholar and collector of Chinese art, was trained in classical Chinese painting in Shanghai before settling in New York in 1947. His paintings drew upon Chinese conventions while reflecting his engagement with modern Western art. This particular work continues the long tradition in which mountain imagery expresses the vast forces of nature and man’s place in the cosmos. Yet, with his expressionistic painting of massive granite cliffs and dramatically lit storm clouds, Wang achieves a new portrayal of the venerable landscape theme.
 Lynn Hyman Butler’s Coney Island Kaleidoscope series combats the idea of Coney Island as a time capsule of nostalgia. During a period of crime and political and financial instability, artists such as Butler considered the site’s uncertain fate as a subject for their work. Saturated colors glide through these playful images, taken while Butler was physically in motion, emulating the vision of a visitor in flux on an amusement park ride. The figures in these two photographs stride forward boldly in contemporary attire: sundresses and straw hats, and leather vests with tattooed arms. The vibrant energy and sense of movement and chaos reject sentimentality, alluding to the velocity of time. Butler is interested in conveying the rush of disorder and the change from past to present Coney Island, and aims to signal the need for historic preservation in its future.
 At the time that Steeplechase closed in 1964—a victim of rising crime, neighborhood decline, and competing entertainment—a new amusement park, Astroland, had already been established for a few years between Surf Avenue and the boardwalk west of West Tenth Street. This park carried on the Coney tradition during the following decades. In 1983, the not-for-profit corporation Coney Island USA was created to assist in rejuvenating Coney Island’s amusement life. It developed many of the programs that later generations of visitors recognize, such as the Mermaid Parade, Sideshows by the Seashore, and concerts on the boardwalk. Lynn Butler’s dynamic take on the site in her Coney Island Kaleidoscope series documents a gritty and still spectacular Coney Island.
 For her series Coney Island Kaleidoscope, Lynn Hyman Butler photographed while in motion “to capture the sense of time passing.” The resulting effect produces dreamscapes saturated with color: riderless kiddie horses hypnotically glide in The Red Horse; a teenager holds either a toy gun or the real thing in The Girl with a Gun. Butler wants her photographs to serve as reminders that “the decision of whether to save or relinquish landscapes such as these will be of increasing urgency.” The nighttime scene behind the gun-toting girl features neon signs for the famous El Dorado Carousel, the Wonder Wheel, and the Cyclone, which alert the viewer to the potential dangers of demolition and development — to what can still be lost.

 In the portfolio Samar Hussein Vera Lutter commemorates the civilian deaths caused by the war in Iraq since the invasion on March 20, 2003. The title derives from the name of the thirteen-year-old Iraqi girl who was the first recorded civilian casualty. Lutter adopts images of a hibiscus flower’s life cycle, from the opening of the bud to the blossom’s final disintegration, as a metaphor of the transience of human existence. The petals’ reds, pinks, and ivories, which mimic the tones of human flesh, further underscore the comparison.
 This photograph is part of Mitch Epstein’s series Family Business, which traces the decline of Holyoke, Massachusetts, a once-prosperous industrial town, through the example of his own family’s waning fortunes. The series becomes a metaphor for many small American towns in flux, depopulated and with jobs in short supply.Walls darkened by soot, Apartment 304, 398 Main Street shows a building belonging to Epstein’s father that was condemned after a fire. Yet the image also forms a stunning still life—an emblem of the fragility of life.
 Anthony Goicolea’s Ice Storm depicts a frigid, fable-like place, an ambiguous and unsettling enchanted forest where a group of young men, seemingly knitting and some of them masked, gather in isolation. Inspired by myths, fairytales, dreams, and childhood fantasies, Goicolea’s image, part of a series called Sheltered Life, is a mysterious landscape partly constructed by the artist with the help of digital technology. Like the other images from this series, Ice Storm focuses on alternative living spaces in environments that often dwarf the inhabitants. The remains of an animal carcass, leftovers of an enigmatic, primeval scene, lie at the foot of the tree in the foreground, while brown bags of unknown content can be seen in several places. The beauty of icicles and ice-covered twigs, but also the dangers amid the rocky outcrops and ravines in these unforgiving and overwhelming surroundings, pose questions about this particular living arrangement.
Geometric shapes defined by densely brushed dots fill this canvas by the contemporary Australian Aboriginal artist Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungurrayi. Part of an artistic movement that began in the early 1970s with the Pintupi clan, of which he is a member, Tjungurrayi adopted the format of painting on canvas to depict what might be considered a cosmological landscape that encompasses the past, present, and future. The serpents relate to ancestors who created the waterholes, indicated by concentric circles, at a specific desert, with the background patterns representing its sand hills. These symbols are drawn from centuries-old cultural traditions of Australian indigenous peoples—including stories of creation, legends of ancestors, and daily customs—that are passed down orally or through ephemeral sand paintings.
 This mask represents Bak’was, a malevolent, ghostly spirit and the keeper of drowned souls in Kwakwaka’wakw culture. Although he is diminutive, his stride is four times the length of a man’s. He has a green, hairy body and a skeletal visage. Those drawn into the forest by him or who eat his food go mad, losing their souls and becoming part of his ghostly retinue. A soul can be saved by subduing Bak’was with menstrual blood. Bak’was appears when family ancestral masks are worn during performances of Tla’sala potlatch ceremonies, special tribal celebrations. Esta máscara representa a Bak’was, un espíritu fantasmal malévolo, guardián de las almas ahogadas en la cultura Kwakwaka’wakw. Aunque diminuto, sus pasos son cuatro veces el largo de los de un hombre. Tiene un cuerpo verde y peludo y rasgos esqueléticos. Aquellos empujados al bosque por él, o los que han comido de su comida enloquecen, perdiendo sus almas y volviéndose parte de su séquito fantasmal. El alma puede salvarse sometiendo a Bak’was con sangre menstrual. Bak’was aparece cuando máscaras ancestrales familiares se utilizan en actos de ceremonias de potlatch Tla’sala, celebraciones tribales especiales.
 ART OF INNOVATIONThese three works speak to the highly inventive history of Yoruba art. Incorporating outside materials, they each reflect how both a colonial past and global exchange shaped shifting ideas about local identity. Even this bead-embroidered crown, the ultimate symbol of Yoruba kingship, is the product of a complex global story. Although the Yoruba have a long history of glassmaking, the large, multicolored ade crown depicts figures wearing bowler hats and contains beads imported by the British in the late nineteenth century into what would soon become the Nigeria colony. The smaller beaded crown, known as an oríkògbòfó, is an evolution of the ade form, but it is modeled after the wig of a British barrister (lawyer), still worn in court today by members of the Nigerian judiciary. Yinka Shonibare, a British artist of Yoruba and Nigerian descent, used Dutch wax-printed fabric to create Skipping Girl. This material—a commodity associated with Africa but actually created in Europe, based on Indonesian designs, and sold in West Africa—serves as a symbol of the web of economic and cultural interrelationships among Africa, Asia, and Europe. Shonibare exposes cultural "authenticity" as an illusion and evokes the layers of historical connections among global cultures.
 Titus Kaphar’s The Jerome Project (My Loss) belongs to a larger series of the same title that the artist began in 2011. Searching online databases for his father’s prison record, he found dozens listed who shared his father’s first name, Jerome, as well as his surname. Struck by this discovery, he created ten-inch portraits of each Jerome, based on their mug shots. The diptych on view here shows Kaphar’s own father, at a much larger scale than in previous works in the series. Depicting African American men, who are greatly overrepresented in the prison system, the portraits are simultaneously individual and collective. The panels were painted on flat gold-leaf backgrounds and partially submerged in tar. Initially, the level of the tar reflected the percentage of each lifetime spent in prison, but Kaphar abandoned this formula in acknowledgment of incarceration’s lingering aftereffects, such as difficulty securing employment and loss of voting rights. The portraits draw on the visual tradition of Byzantine icons, specifically depictions of Saint Jerome, patron saint of students, librarians, and scholars.
 ART OF SATIREMasks are particularly useful for expressing disapproval and thus reinforcing communal values. These two masks performed instructional and critical messages about proper behavior and political discontent. Male Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. This mask depicts a French gendarme, a colonial soldier, and was most likely performed as a critique of French personal and political behavior during the colonial period. The mask depicting Elvis Presley belonged to the Nyau society (to which all Chewa men belong), an institution that governs the spiritual realm of death and the ancestors. The society’s masks always represent the spirits of the deceased, but they may also represent wild bush spirits or caricature personalities from the wider community. Outsiders—including Swahili slave traders, British officials, the Virgin Mary, and other iconic foreigners such as Elvis Presley— have been considered representative of antisocial traits and undesirable values.
 Today covered in a coat of red paint, the steel tower of the Parachute Jump is the only remaining sign of Steeplechase Park. In the years during and after World War II, riders were hoisted to the top of the tower in a canvas seat attached to a closed parachute. When they were dropped from the top, only the parachute would slow the descent. Like the Wonder Wheel, the Cyclone, and Childs Restaurant, the tower is now protected by its landmark status and will remain at Coney Island even after the redevelopment of the area. Like several other steel structures that made their way to Coney Island, the Parachute Jump originated as a ride at a world’s fair (in this case, the 1939 New York World’s Fair), reflecting the often-utopian nature of the ventures that developed Coney Island over its history.
 Morrison Cousins, a noted American industrial designer, was hired by the houseware company Tupperware to redesign its ubiquitous kitchen food storage vessels in the 1980s. This strikingly reductivist tazza also was designed by Cousins, but not for retail; it was a limited-edition incentive award for Tupperware distributors in Japan.
 In the postwar period Coney Island remained an almost obligatory subject for most photographers visiting or living in New York. New and more affordable lightweight cameras allowed photographers to be freer in the exploration of their topic. Brooklyn-born Stephen Salmieri had just graduated from School of Visual Arts in New York when he started his Coney Island series in 1966. Working in the tradition of many mid-twentieth-century independent photographers (such as Robert Frank and Lisette Model) who found Coney Island an inspiring subject, Salmieri spent the following six years documenting a decaying area, still full of life. Last summer there was still a limited stretch of concession stands on the Bowery, not much different from the ones in Salmieri’s suite of images. Even though some barkers are now relying on electronic amplification to lure passersby to their games, the original intention remains the same.
 Glenn Ligon’s work, known for its stenciled quotes, often blends reportage, words, and images in ways that challenge traditional classification. The artist explores issues surrounding race, sexuality, politics, and representation. In 2003 he discovered that one of his earlier print projects, featuring text from the author Zora Neale Huston’s 1928 essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me,” had not been cancelled by the printer. Cancellation of a series (by marking the plates with an X) ensures that no unauthorized copies of an artist’s work are executed. For Untitled (Cancellation Prints), Ligon himself cancelled the plates by drawing large drypoint Xs on them but then authorized an edition from them. The artist stated, “Cancelled but present, new but haunted by the ghosts of their earlier meanings, the prints speak to the mutability of questions of racial identity and a shift in the cultural context in which the original works were received.”
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Relate to Your Heritage combines the visual language of psychedelic posters with multiple fragments of African American female figures, constructing a culturally specific articulation of femininity and power. Both this work and Eyes of Time point to the importance of the feminine form in linking a collective mythic history to present-day autonomy and power. Barbara Jones-Hogu was a founding member of AfriCOBRA, a movement of visual artists formed in 1968 that sought “an approach to image making which would reflect and project the moods, attitudes, and sensibilities” of African American self-determination.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 Wayne Higby calls upon the western landscape of his childhood to create works that pay homage to the grandeur of nature and create a focal point for meditation. In the “Trapped Terrace Gap” Bowl the fracture of the ground represented on the outside wall of the piece is continued on the opposite inside wall. Seen from the proper angle, this natural feature jumps the “canyon” of the void between the walls. At the same time, the earthenware bowl is made from the very earth it represents.
 Using Coney Island as a setting, the photographer John Murphy created tableaux that captured the bleakness of the lives of fictional sideshow and carnival people. Here, a woman straddling a wooden chair faces a painted banner advertising her act at Coney Island’s Lido Theater, which closed in the 1970s. The contrast between her former glory as a performer and her current reality, emphasized by the empty room, is stark.
 A seemingly endless stretch of empty beach underscores the tranquility of this scene photographed by Harvey Zipkin. A small African American congregation heads to the water for a baptism. In the distance sits the Half Moon Hotel, a once popular Coney Island venue that was demolished in 1996, two years after this image was taken.

 During the last decade of his life, Philip Guston made paintings that combined the imagery of his early murals with the gestural brushstroke of his abstract painting of the 1950s. He created narratives in a cartoon-like style, returning repeatedly to certain motifs, all evident here: the solitary light bulb, severed arms and legs, horseshoes, and the soles of hobnailed boots. Brushed in broad strokes and a vivid red palette, the objects set against a curtain in an interior space allude to tragic events, both personal and in the wider world.
 With a kaleidoscopic array of brilliant colors and bold geometric patterns, Romare Bearden evoked the mystery and vitality of African spiritual traditions in Wizard’s Domaine. Although there is no clear narrative, the white-robed figure at right seems to be entreating the winged character of the wizard, gazing down on his domain from the sky. The remainder of the composition is densely packed with the forms of a building, other figures and animals, and plants, as well as abstract symbols and decorative passages.Throughout his career, Bearden was particularly interested in the African American experience, but he also believed that a universal “prevalence of ritual” united people across generations and cultures. He drew stylistic inspiration from a variety of sources, including African art, Cubist and Dadaist collage, jazz music, and Caribbean landscapes.This work has been placed on view as part of Romare Bearden: 20th Century American Master, a centennial tribute organized by the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Romare Bearden Foundation. Events and installations nationwide mark the hundredth anniversary of Bearden’s birth. For more information, visit beardencentennial.org. To find out where to view other Bearden artworks in the tristate area between now and September 2012, visit studiomuseum.org.Born in North Carolina, Bearden moved to Harlem with his family in 1920. He produced his earliest work as a cartoonist for school publications at Boston University and New York University. While at NYU, he took art classes at the Art Students League. Following his service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Bearden studied philosophy in Paris, where he came into contact with modernist artists. Back in New York, he supported himself as a songwriter and a social worker in the early 1950s and then resumed his work as an artist in the 1960s. He was a founding member of Spiral, a collective of African American artists formed in 1963 to explore their role in American art and society. During this period, Bearden began making the widely acclaimed collages that became the hallmark of his oeuvre.
 The proportions of this piece by the prominent installation artist Pepón Osorio are rather ambiguous: the two giant stuffed cats seem to be too large for the narrow table on which they sit. This incongruity reflects the artist’s recollections of visiting his mother’s apartment, filled with knickknacks and figurines, when he was an art student. The objects were in sharp contrast with the aesthetic values of the art world he was entering, and his conflicting feelings of repulsion and attraction assumed giant dimensions in his mind.
 This coiled basket is anything but traditionally executed. It was created especially for the Museum by the artist. Around the exterior it depicts eleven different women, each wearing the traditional dress of her tribe or nation. Each woman holds a three-dimensional basket woven in the style of her people and, facing outward, presents it to the world. The circle of women is repeated on the interior, where they compose a community of basket makers and present their baskets to each other.
