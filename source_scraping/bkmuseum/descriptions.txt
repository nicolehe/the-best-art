Kate Gilmore sets up scenarios in which she performs tasks that test her physical endurance, such as breaking out of confining spaces, scaling high walls, or moving heavy objects. These feats are at once potentially dangerous and seemingly meaningless, yet the artist enacts them repeatedly with unwavering determination and focus. Gilmore originally executed and recorded Blood from a Stone in the Museum’s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art before the work appeared in the 2009–10 exhibition Reflections on the Electric Mirror: New Feminist Video.
 This image shows the rooms that were the elegant Detroit executive offices of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, in the 1910s and 1920s. The wood paneling has lost its luster, and a lush carpet of brilliant green moss now covers the floor. The decrepit state of Ford’s office—a contemporary ruin of a glorious, not too distant past—becomes a metaphor not only for the fate of the automobile industry or of this once wealthy and important Midwestern city, but also for the deindustrialization of America.
 ART OF TRAUMABoth of these very different Congolese works are deeply emotional expressions. One was commissioned to resolve a personal trauma, while the other represents a viscerally remembered social upheaval from the colonial era. Figures like this mother and child were believed to offer protection, through the intervention of spirits, by the Bwanga Bwa Cibola society. When a woman lost successive children through miscarriages or early infant death, she could be initiated into the society to protect herself from ominous forces suspected to be the cause of the deaths. This emotionally gripping figure is considered to be one of the great masterpieces of African art. Tshibumba's painting depicts the slaughter of striking mineworkers in Lubumbashi at the order of the Belgian colonial government on December 9, 1941. The artist critiques the institutions complicit in the colonial system: Belgium (represented by the flag), the church, the mining company, the colonial governor (with arm raised), and the Congolese soldiers in the colonial army. Following independence in 1960, a market for narrative painting developed among urban Congolese who were working in mining factories and living in new, Western-style homes.
 Since the 1960s Philip Pearlstein has been making paintings of human bodies posed in interior spaces. The bodies are arranged casually, usually cropped (often at the head), and the harsh, cool light reveals the surfaces and hollows of the flesh. This intense realism recalls the view through a photographic lens.
 Through her photographs, Cass Bird asserts the positive existence of people who push the perceived boundaries of gender. In this way she suggests a world that is Whitmanesque in rejecting society’s restrictions. In this photograph, taken on a rooftop in Brooklyn, Bird’s friend Macaulay stares out from under a cap emblazoned with the words “I Look Just Like My Daddy.” Macaulay’s gender is ambiguous. Her cap’s proclamation is likewise ambiguous—perhaps it is true, or perhaps it is an ironic statement of an expectation that will never be realized.
 The street artist Swoon’s ethereal installation juxtaposes five portraits with the Cyclone, one of the last existing wooden roller coasters. As if it were seen in their dreams, the Cyclone’s lace-like structure acquires a gossamer quality. Given Swoon’s fascination with Coney Island’s ceaseless potential for magic and mystery, her three-dimensional dreamscape may represent a cautiously optimistic belief in the site’s continual rebirth.
 Throughout her long and prolific career Niki de Saint Phalle, a former cover model for Life magazine and French Vogue, investigated feminine archetypes and women’s societal roles. Her Nanas, bold, sexy sculptures of the proverbial everywoman, are playful and empowering, while the whimsical lithographs My Love We Won’t and Dear Diana offer humorous takes on girlhood obsessions. The savvy My Heart Belongs to Marcel pays homage not to Daddy (as in the popular song), but to Marcel Duchamp, the influential Dada artist and a personal friend.

 The Empty City: Fragrant Creek is from a series that comments on the fate of the cities, towns, and villages along the Yangtze River that were evacuated ahead of the flooding expected from the Three Gorges Dam in China. The main subject here is the river itself, meandering through the entire image. On its banks, caught amid tangled vegetation, are the remains of former human habitation; we are witnessing the brutal results of forced displacement. Eventually, the coming flood will submerge this scene.Despite the highly contemporary references, the artist has chosen to use traditional Chinese techniques and visual symbolism. He uses layered mulberry paper, applying ink, watercolor, and mineral pigments, and often distresses the paper by overworking it.
 Hairstyles are often complex signifiers of identity and social status, particularly for the Yoruba people. They can indicate a woman’s age, her occupation, and, in some contexts, her religious or political power. Many hairdos are also tied to specific ceremonies, such as a wedding or the naming ceremony of a child. Working over three decades, J. D. ’Okhai Ojeikere undertook a photographic series systematically documenting the rich variety of Nigerian hairstyles. He sought to capture the diversity and beauty of the hairdos he witnessed in the streets of cities and villages, in marketplaces and offices, and at parties, celebrations, and festivals around the country. Most of the photographs, like Fro Fro and Suku Sinero Kiko, were taken from behind, revealing and emphasizing the abstract and sculptural aspects of the hairdos.

 In a thirty-year photographic project, Ojeikere sought to systematically document the rich variety and beauty of the contemporary Nigerian hairstyles he witnessed in daily life. Most of the photographs, like Abebe, were taken from behind, revealing the abstract and sculptural aspects of the hairdos.Hairstyles are often complex signifiers of identity and social status, particularly for the Yoruba. They can indicate a woman’s age, her occupation, her religious or political power, or even her state of mind. Many hairdos are also tied to specific ceremonies, such as a wedding or the naming ceremony of a child. The abebe (fan) style shown here has an implication of “coolness,” composure, and royalty, qualities that are ideally linked.
 In her Waterfall series, Pat Steir has explored the imagery of water, continuing her fascination with landscape. This work, which verges on abstraction, is nevertheless an evocative representation of a waterfall. The artist applied a number of horizontal brushstrokes loaded with thinned paint at the top of the canvas, and the paint streamed down in lines, drips, and rivulets, emulating the properties of water.
 When I'm doing my pottery I think of Mom [Marie Z. Chino] first, and that she could help me. I want to do like she does. She didn't need outlining, she just painted, and sometimes I do that now I know the design and I just do it.-Grace Chino, quoted in Rick Dillingham, Fourteen Families in Pueblo Pottery (1994)The Chino family, led by the matriarch Marie Z. Chino, was innovative in adapting the designs found on prehistoric pottery shards to modern pottery forms. Grace Chino here used a dazzling, closely lined black-and-white design on a new vessel form reminiscent of ancient Pueblo pots. The result is a form of abstraction that embraces tradition as essential to innovation.
 Melvin Edwards’s weighty sculptures combine nails, tools, gears, and other metal objects to create abstract compositions. This work belongs to his extensive Lynch Fragment series, begun in the 1960s and inspired by Ralph Ginzburg’s 100 Years of Lynching (1962), a collection of newspaper reports of lynchings published to commemorate the centennial of the Civil War. The Lynch Fragment sculptures evoke this history of violence through their jarring juxtaposition of forms and rough welding. Takawira–J, a later work from the series, was made while Edwards was teaching in Zimbabwe and was named for John Takawira, a sculptor he met there.
 My grandmother braided my hair as she did when I was a child, with pigtails, barrettes, and ribbons. It was her way of adorning me as her champion porcelain doll. This image captures a rare moment where she wanted to make a portrait of me with her and her dolls. I set up one light and ran a cable release behind my back. There was nobody present but Grandma Ruby and me. We both quietly sat up and looked over our shoulders into the lens. I pressed the cable release, and the shutter clicked for nearly one second. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Valerie Hegarty’s Fallen Bierstadt is inspired by the work of the renowned nineteenth-century American landscape painter Albert Bierstadt (whose monumental A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie hangs to the right). Hegarty was drawn to the way nineteenth-century landscape artists depicted vast expanses of wilderness as an expression of “Manifest Destiny,” the notion that the United States was divinely entitled to expand across the entire North American continent. In Fallen Bierstadt the “canvas” appears to decay, as if affected by the ravages of nature. The title seems to refer both to the physical appearance of the piece and to the end of a heroic tradition of landscape painting.
 Liu Dan received his early education from his grandfather. Following the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), he entered the Jiangsu Chinese Painting Institute to gain formal training. Meticulous brushwork and subtle gradations in ink tones are hallmarks of his painting style.This monumental painting depicts a Taihu rock, or spirit stone, a variety of limestone appreciated by Chinese connoisseurs for the way it suggests a landscape in miniature. The rock's combination of abstract forms and voided space also recalls Chinese calligraphy. These stones were often installed in gardens or on the desks of scholars as focal points for meditation. In the hands of a contemporary artist, the traditional Taihu rock form becomes a modernist abstraction.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 John I. H. Baur, head of the Brooklyn Museum’s Department of Painting and Sculpture from 1936 to 1952, here appears seated in an interior space, perhaps his office. His body, cropped at the head and ankle, fills the frame. Alice Neel captured idiosyncrasies such as his lightly rumpled suit, wrinkled face, and veiny hands. One of her guiding principles as a portraitist was, in her words, that “every person is a new universe unique with its own laws.”
 Unlike the majority of American painters who were engaged with gestural abstraction at mid-century, Hale Woodruff remained rooted in an artistic process that originated with traditional notions of subject matter. A leading African American artist of the period, Woodruff had devoted his energies emphatically to subjects relevant to the black experience and the civil rights effort beginning in the 1930s. After his move to New York in 1946 and a decisive turn to abstraction, he executed numerous landscapes such as this one, in which the forms are intended to convey the character of a particular place and time of day.
 Gowanus Canal from 2nd Street is a meticulously executed image of an old Brooklyn industrial waterway. Amid the abundant vegetation, figures equipped with long poles search for something in the murky water. The large warehouse in the middle of this carefully balance composition seems to be abandoned. Car tires, wrecked buses, and cars on the right slowly change into the jagged outline of a cityscape in the background. The canal's still waters are embellished by the reflections of its environs. There is an inherent beauty in this melancholic scene. We begin to understand the attraction this human-made waterway has for Brooklyn residents. At present, the cleanup of the Gowanus Canal and plans for its recreational use are under way.
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.

 Elsa Rady’s porcelain vessels merge Asian ceramic tradition with the simplicity of modern European and American design. In the course of her career, Rady began to focus on the sculptural aspects of her work rather than the utilitarian features usually associated with the vessel form. In 1990 she began to assemble her pieces in groups of various sizes. The works of her Still Life series are tableaux in which the individual pieces relate to each other very much as objects in traditional still-life paintings do. In Still Life IV two distinctly different vessels are paired on an aluminum shelf that is attached to a rectangular backdrop, which suggests the clearly defined pictorial plane of a painting.
 Growing up on the urban terrain of concrete sidewalks, Brooklyn children and teenagers have long embraced skating as a pastime. In 1950 N. Jay Jaffee photographed a young skater as she extended her arm out to gain balance independent of her father’s hold. Vincent Cianni’s 1995 image captures a graceful moment of a teenage boy midair. The backgrounds of these images reveal changing textures of the neighborhood landscapes: felt hats with fur trim and arched glass storefront windows in the former, and baggy T-shirts and graffiti scrawled along a block in the latter. Although taken forty-five years apart, these photographs display skating as a communal and enjoyed act for Brooklyn youth.
 Originally built for the 1939 New York World’s Fair, the Parachute Jump has been a Coney Island landmark since 1941. Stephen Salmieri photographed the structure seven years after the ride ceased operating, when urban decline resulted in a vastly changed landscape.
 
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”

 Pretend #2 is constructed from three images of women with their young children. As in most of her work, both as a philosopher and as an artist, Adrian Piper addresses the social and economic imbalance of our world and the issue of racism. In the central image a Caucasian mother smiles proudly, looking straight into the camera. She seems unaware of the anguish of the African mother at the left or the Asian mother at the right. The silkscreened text across the bottom, “Pretend not to know what you know,” connects the three images and forces the viewer to contemplate the frequent denials we choose to make to lessen the pangs of conscience.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 Japanese pottery has always been closely associated with the tea ceremony. From ancient times the great Japanese tea masters used ceramic utensils to reflect their own ideas and style. One example is Oribe ware, named for the tea master Furuta Oribe (1544â1615). Oribe ceramics are distinguished by warped forms and bold pictorial patternsâa departure from earlier symmetrical designs. The Oribe tradition continues to the present, as indicated by the work of Takiguchi Kiheiji shown here.
 Blinds relates to Mary Heilmann’s so-called Jealousy Paintings, a series of abstract works initiated in the 1970s that was inspired by details of the artist’s immediate surroundings, such as air vents, French doors, and window blinds. The name of the series is a play on jalousie, a colloquial French word for window louvers or blinds, and a nod to the novel La Jalousie, by one of the artist’s favorite authors, Alain Robbe-Grillet. Blinds playfully questions the Renaissance concept of paintings as windows that offer a glimpse of other worlds, contiguous with ours. With its edges brushed gold to simulate a picture frame or, even, a window frame, Blinds nevertheless asserts its identity as a planar object.
 May Stevens has been a committed political activist throughout her long career. Her Big Daddy series began in response to her disappointment and anger over the Vietnam War. For Stevens, Big Daddy takes on aspects of both the personal and the political. Based on a portrait of her resolutely patriotic father, the obviously male figure is also reminiscent of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919). Here, the figure’s bullet-shaped head exaggerates his phallic power and capacity for violence. However, by depicting him as a paper doll, to be dressed up as an executioner, decorated soldier, policeman, or butcher, Stevens ultimately strips Big Daddy of his patriarchal command.
 Fernando Mastrangelo appropriates one of Mexico’s national symbols, the Aztec Calendar Stone, which dates from about 1500 and symbolizes the creation of the Aztec universe. Retaining the central skeletal face of Tonatiuh, the Sun God, Mastrangelo fills the surrounding areas with contemporary consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, candy, sparkplugs, and toothpaste.The depiction of corn-based products draws attention to Mexico’s mass cultivation of corn to meet energy needs (via ethanol) and foreign consumer demands. At the same time, an iconic Aztec image suggests parallels between the conquest of Mexico by the Spanish, centuries ago, and the present-day exploitation of local Mexican corn production by North American agribusiness.
 In Blossom, a piano inexplicably fused with a tree plays "Strange Fruit" (in an arrangement by the artist). The song, popularized in the 1930s by Billie Holiday, protests the atrocity of lynching: "Southern trees bear a strange fruit, / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root, / Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze, / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees." The haunting lyrics suggest that the fused piano may be read as a surrogate for a violated human body.Influenced by a 2006 incident in Jena, Louisiana, in which nooses were dangled from a tree at a racially troubled high school, the piece also evokes the rich cross-cultural symbolism of trees: Biggers alludes to the story of Buddha finding enlightenment under a bodhi tree. This unlikely combination demonstrates his interest in multiplicities of both inspiration and interpretation.
 Born features a theme that has prevailed in Kiki Smith’s work for years—the relationship between animals, particularly wolves, and humans. This image subverts the story line of one of the world’s best-known fairy tales by imagining Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother as born of the wolf rather than eaten by him.
 
 Betty Woodman is one of the preeminent ceramic artists working today. In her pieces she combines traditional techniques and materials with her own innovations, constantly crossing the boundaries between fine arts and crafts to extend the possibilities of ceramics. Still-Life Vase #10, from a series begun in 1990, displays the boldness of this artist’s approach. A fully developed large vase is the core of the piece, but its form gets almost obliterated by the dramatically painted surface. Large protruding wings, or handles, attached at the sides are themselves shaped as incomplete, flat vessels adorned with handles and other protrusions. Thus, the piece presents an arrangement of objects in space, a fundamental feature of the still-life genre in visual art.
 Polly Apfelbaum’s The Dwarves without Snow White demonstrates the artist’s interest in expanding the accustomed boundaries of painting. Apfelbaum paints with dyes on rectangles of crushed velvet that are then folded, showing the underlying layers of colors, and placed on cardboard boxes. The boxes function as pedestals for the painted velvet, integrating painting and sculpture in a single work. According to Apfelbaum, the box is a metaphor for the artist’s paint box as well as for the painted wedding chest, which historically held the trousseau that defined a woman’s standing in society. The title refers to the well-known fairy tale and its ideals of femininity.
 In the ongoing series Sunday Paintings, Byron Kim inscribes personal notes about his daily life onto his painted images of the sky. In nuanced hues of blue, each of the six examples shown here represents the sky on the Sunday it was painted. The words sit on the picture plane, creating a play between the painting as a flat surface and as a window opening onto the illusion of deep space. Lined up on a wall, the Sunday Paintings have a cinematic quality: each panel looks like a frame in a film sequence—a moment in time stilled—as if each is a part of a larger ongoing whole. While the works were created on Sundays, the title of this series also refers to amateurs known as “Sunday painters,” admired by Kim for the purity of their motives in making art.
 In his painting, Mark Bradford, a Los Angeles-based artist, incorporates the materials of his other profession, as a hair stylist, into his paintings. Blending the tools of the African American beauty trade with the more traditional medium of paint on canvas, Bradford crafts works that comment on both aesthetic and cultural phenomena. Pairing a "high art" medium with objects from daily life enables the artist to create subtle works that demonstrate his passion for issues of race, class, gender, and art-world politics.

 Corot builds the gently sloping silhouette of the mountain range with thin, transparent films of brown, gray, and blue paint in broad, visible brushstrokes. For the sky, he matches thick layers of blue, gray, and white pigment with expanses of paper prepared with a light base or ground coat of paint. Corot endows the stand of firs in the foreground with an unexpected calligraphic flatness and reduces the tree trunks to stems. His passion for painting out-of-doors in front of the subject—notably on three visits to Italy and several trips around France—earned him the reverence of subsequent generations of landscape painters, particularly the Impressionists.
 Here, Stephen Salmieri focuses on a balloon-toss worker at Coney Island whose down-turned teased hairstyle resembles the inflated balloons in the background. By isolating the subject and cropping out the surrounding amusement park activity, he establishes a sense of intimacy, as though the viewer could be next in line to play the game.
 Teri Greeves created this piece by hand-sewing beads, Swarovski crystals, silver conchos, and spiny-oyster shell cabochons on a pair of high-heeled tennis shoes designed by Steve Madden. The inner panels are inspired by Great Lakes tribes’ floral designs. The outside panels depict contemporary jingle dress dancers swaying to the drumming during a powwow. Each woman depicted on the shoes wears full regalia, including a beaded dress, moccasins, and a belt with real silver conchos. Greeves’s detailed beadwork melds traditional technique with modern fashion in a lively contemporary tour de force.
 Regional Work #2 is from a series of diptychs called Regional Pieces done by the artist in 1976. Here one panel depicts a seascape of dark purples, and the other a fish immersed in the same purple waters. Each panel is framed by drapery made of brightly painted Celastic, a clothlike material, giving the impression of viewing the image through a window (one above the sea line and the other below, looking directly into the ocean). Writing about her work, Morton referred to “the responsibility of the artist . . . to be free, and while in that freedom, to look, and to see while looking, and to feel, and to respond while feeling, and to be romantic, and to love the romance.”
 ART OF CREATIONWhile these works appear quite different on the surface, both are made from the same material, terracotta. They were also created through very similar techniques, in which the artist built up the form from thin coils of clay to produce a hollow vessel that could be further sculpted and fired. The head from the Nok culture is an archaeological fragment, possibly once part of a full figure. One of the oldest pieces in the African collection, it was found at one of the earliest known iron-smelting sites in Africa. Magdalene Odundo, a contemporary artist drawing on the global history of pottery, used an understated anthropomorphic vocabulary to create this abstract, burnished vessel that evokes the female form. Odundo achieved the black, smoky finish by covering her pots with a clay slip and firing them in a closed kiln with combustible materials such as wood chips. Since pottery has long been associated with women’s work across the African continent, some scholars have speculated that female artists created the ancient Nok statuary. It is thus possible that the two works displayed here—among the African collection's oldest and newest, respectively—may both be by women artists.
 Part of a series that features lengths of decommissioned fire hoses, In Case of Race Riot II exemplifies Theaster Gates’s practice of civic responsibility and social engagement. The work alludes to the Civil Rights Movement and, in particular, the use of high-pressure water hoses on peaceful African American demonstrators in Birmingham, Alabama, in May 1963. However, the possibility of future use of the fire hose, as suggested by the title, questions an easy acceptance of this tumultuous era of American history and points to the ongoing struggles for African Americans’ civil rights.
 Thomas E. Warren’s “Centripetal Spring” chair is the forerunner of Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf’s Aeron chair, designed nearly 150 years later. Both are made principally of metal, raised on casters for mobility, rotate on a central column, and allow for adjustment of the angle of the seat. The very different look of the chairs suggests the ways that consumer attitudes toward industrial invention and modernity have evolved over the centuries. Although Warren’s chair bears a patent mark (on the bottom of the seat), he felt the need to mitigate the newness of his invention by concealing its ingenious metal spring system beneath a dense, soft curtain of luxurious passementerie (elaborate trim). Similarly, he disguised his progressive use of cast iron for the frame by rendering it in the backward-looking Rococo Revival style and gilding it. In contrast, the makers of the Aeron chair reveal its mechanical elements, celebrate its recycled man-made materials, and use a monochromatic black to underline the seriousness of the design, all without fear of losing customers.
 
 Harry Lapow began frequenting Coney Island to capture quirks of the beach and boardwalk after receiving a Ciroflex camera on his forty-third birthday. He was intrigued by the camera’s ability to isolate details and fleeting moments of everyday life. Here, a toddler’s crossed legs appear above the head of a buried woman whose eyes are covered by a floral towel. In cropping this beach sighting, Lapow crafts a surprising juxtaposition, forming an unlikely dynamic between the lively child and the masked adult.
 In 1967, Richard Diebenkorn began a series of paintings named Ocean Park after the section of Santa Monica, California, where he had his studio. In contrast to his preceding, figurative group of works, this new series of abstract images allowed the artist to employ, as he put it, "an allover light which wasn't possible in the representational works, which seem somewhat dingy by comparison." In Ocean Park No.27, Diebenkorn reduces the scene to planes and fragments of color. Depth and spatial illusion are suggested by the color's changing density and the composition's system of receding lines. Using a low-key palette devoid of harsh tones, the artist accomplishes his stated goal of communicating "a feeling of strength in reserve, tension beneath calm."
 This powerful commentary on the history of war and race in America is from a series of nine mixed-media collages that the artist Joyce Kozloff calls “a kind of personal, quirky history of America.” The current invasion of Iraq was the emotional catalyst for this work, which portrays a trail of geopolitical conflicts. This piece, the fifth in the series, is composed of appropriated imagery, including musical notes and song lyrics taken from 1920s game boards given to the artist by her mother. It depicts laboring slaves as well as Civil War soldiers, languid antebellum women, cotton fields, steamships, trains, churches, and other period structures. Words from slave songs and Bible hymns, and texts about “The War of Independence,” the Mason and Dixon Line, and Gettysburg are dispersed throughout the work.
 
 ART OF HISTORYHistory is about power, and its depiction is a consequential act. These two works—a technically refined casting of precious materials for a powerful monarch, and a group of movable wood figures celebrating a new democratic era—commemorate specific important moments in the political histories of their respective societies. The Edo figure glorifies the spirit of a deceased king, or oba, who ruled the kingdom of Benin at the height of its power. A motif on the figure's kilt depicting an elephant, whose trunk ends in a human right hand, identifies this work with the reign of the oba Esigie, who ruled from 1504 to 1550. Johannes Segogela's sculpture addresses the South African transition from the armed liberation struggle against whites-only apartheid rule into the new democratic era, born the following year with the multiracial elections that swept Nelson Mandela to power. The work suggests the need for South Africans to cast their weapons into the furnace.
 This photograph from early in Cindy Sherman’s artistic career indicates a burgeoning interest in what has become a lifelong investigation into using herself as subject. Produced in 1975, during her time as an art student at the State University of New York, Buffalo, the work prefigures her famous Untitled Film Stills series by two years. In it, the artist references Claude Cahun, an early Surrealist photographer whose androgynous self-portraits inspired a later generation of feminist theorists to think about gender as a social role that is performed rather than innate—ideas that would become central to Sherman’s oeuvre from the mid-1970s onward.
 A modern-day coat of arms assembled from images of luxury consumer items, this collage could be regarded as a catalogue of status symbols coveted by contemporary celebrities. Within the traditional heraldic format, the central image of rapper LL Cool J is flanked by large gold Rolex watches. Inspired by coats of arms on the facades of historical European buildings, Rashaad Newsome brings this tradition, which originated in the mid-twelfth century, into the present.
 The Coney Island Polar Bear Club, the earliest organization of its kind, was founded in 1903 by Bernarr Macfadden, known as the “Father of Physical Culture.” An early advocate for outdoor exercise, Macfadden believed that taking a dip in the ocean during the winter could restore one’s immunity and stamina. Here, members of the Polar Bear Club pose on the beach on a snowy winter day.
 While spiders may be threatening creatures to many people, for Louise Bourgeois they represent a nurturing quality that she associates with her mother. In a maternal fashion, the spider weaves a perfect web that serves as a protective barrier and provides food. For Bourgeois, the spider also suggests the patience and industriousness that served her mother well as a skilled weaver in the family business of tapestry restoration. Thus, the image of the spider is capable of evoking both threat and tenderness; such a meeting of supposed opposites or a reconciliation of conflicting or even contradictory states is one of the most characteristic features of Louise Bourgeois’s art.
This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 Jean-Michel Othoniel has transformed this utilitarian vehicle—a nineteenth-century covered wagon known as a prairie schooner—into an elegant object of beauty by remaking its canvas cover with panes of blown glass and adding swags and finials composed of oversized glass beads.The artist, who favors alterable materials, began working with sulfur and wax and since 1993 has also experimented with the possibilities presented by glass. The potential for transformation that occurs with this material is echoed here by themes of migration and social change suggested by the covered wagon, part of the collective memory and mythology of American culture.
 Sol LeWitt was a mentor to many younger artists and writers. He was so significant to Lippard’s thinking that she dedicated Six Years to him. While his own practice always led to materialized works, he defined his artistic method as Conceptual, because he would always start from an idea, often permutations of a basic form or repetition of an operation, which he called the “machine that makes the art.” These two sketches show him elaborating the multiple forms of open cubes, and some of the various configurations possible for parallel straight lines.
 Though Kehinde Wiley is best known for his painted portraits, here he shifts from painting to sculpture. In both the lift and turn of the young man’s head and the open V of his zippered collar, this bronze refers to an eighteenth-century marble bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon (see illustration).Yet in many other ways, Wiley’s work could hardly be more different: in substituting male for female, black for white, and present for past, he upends the earlier sculpture even as he quotes it. His radical reinterpretation encourages us to examine the stereotypes that can be found in portraiture.—Rujeko Hockley, Assistant Curator, Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum
 Ellen Lesperance creates knitting patterns based on examples of sweaters she finds in archival photographs of female activists, and then uses these pattern paintings as guides for her hand-knit “historic” sweaters. The neatly lettered title on this painting links it to direct action and political resistance, tracing the radical history of women imprisoned for spearheading antinuclear encampments in the 1980s. Displayed together, Lesperance’s painting and sweater engage this activist history, literally and metaphorically offering a pattern for a new generation.
 Judy Chicago created this test plate for her room-size installation The Dinner Party (on permanent view on the fourth floor of the Museum), a milestone in twentieth-century art. The installation is composed of a banquet arranged on a triangular table with thirty-nine place settings, each commemorating an important woman from history.Dedicated to the black abolitionist and feminist Sojourner Truth (1797–1883), this plate depicts weeping for the suffering of the slaves, a mask concealing the real self, and a fist raised in rage and defiance.
 Geometric and spare, Clay Ketter’s R.T.P.18.B is part of his Renovation Trace Paintings series, initiated in 1995. Constructed out of common building materials including wallboard, paint, and joint compound, this large panel resembles an actual section of a wall with a doorway flanked by cupboards. The image is enigmatic, in a number of ways: The wall could be in the process of either construction or demolition, the place either real or imaginary. Moreover, the muted tones and streamlined aesthetic recall both Bauhaus design and Minimalist sculpture. And, as both object and image, R.T.P.18.B straddles the categories of sculpture and painting. Whatever the object’s significance, the artist’s experience as a carpenter informs the subject and materials of his work.

 Anna Williams, an African American quilt-maker born and raised near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, made quilts throughout her life, incorporating scraps of traditional printed cottons, unusual synthetics, and woven or decorated fabrics such as the sequined pieces seen here. The artist’s bold approach combines traditional block settings with free-flowing improvisation and a masterful use of color. In the late 1980s, Williams’s unique style of quilt-making was recognized by artists and collectors, who encouraged her to exhibit and sell her work.
 Through the Large Glass documents one of Wilke’s most effective and well-known performances, in which she executed a languid striptease behind the cracked transparent surface of Marcel Duchamp’s famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass), 1915–23, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1976. Dressed in a fedora and a man’s white satin suit, she strikes a series of poses evoking the style of 1970s fashion photography and then strips, cleverly suggesting bride and bachelor simultaneously. In her self-conscious affectation of a fashion model, Wilke willfully uses her own image and her sexuality to confront the erotic representation of women in art history and popular culture.
 
 Nayland Blake is known for work that emphasizes issues of race and sexuality. He explores the complexity of racial and sexual identity and social prejudice, using the image of the rabbit to refer to not only gay sexuality and African American heritage but individual freedom from society’s classifications. In 2000 he stated, “I’m using the rabbit as this metaphor for something that’s sort of in-between race. Of indeterminate race. That came from thinking about Br’er Rabbit. . . . Those stories are West African folktales that came into this country with slaves. They’re like the progenitor of Bugs Bunny. So in thinking about my own racial identity, I kept sort of using this rabbit metaphor.”
 In the Quechua-speaking community of Chinchero, men and women wear distinctive garments that identify them by gender and community. Large garments such as this shawl are woven in two parts—symmetrical opposites that are sewn together. Wide blue bands called pampakuna, or fields, are set apart by multi-striped panels filled with colorful geometric designs. Shawls with indigo-blue fields are characteristic of Chinchero women's garments.
 Petah Coyne’s fantastical forms, presenting a beauty that slides into the grotesque, allude to death and decay. Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculpturesproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works—the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.Coyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.
 This work was inspired by Mickalene Thomas’s 2011 residency at the house and gardens of the French Impressionist painter Claude Monet (1840–1926) in Giverny, France (see illustration). Thomas responded strongly to the colors Monet selected for the rooms of his house, the collection of art that hung on the walls, and the views of the garden that were deliberately framed by the windows. The Giverny residency coincided with her adoption of interiors and landscape as motifs in her own work.
 As suggested by her assumed name, the artist known as Swoon is an admirer of urban art like that featured in the special exhibition Graffiti, on view elsewhere on this floor. Trained in printmaking in Prague and at Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute, she decided to take her own art to the streets in l999, pasting her large linoleum- and woodcuts, printed on thin paper, on the sides of the industrial buildings of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side.The artist’s main subjects are the people of the city, often her family members and friends but also strangers. “I go and look at people hanging out on the street,” she says. “So what I wind up with is actually a street scene—a portrait of the city.”Recently, Swoon has begun creating large, intricate installations in which layers of printed and cutout material projecting into space are supplemented by objects found in the street. Brooklyn Museum Installation is a site-specific work based on a 2003 piece called Coney Island Cyclone, after the landmark Brooklyn roller coaster. The artist translates the coaster’s image into an intricate web of printed fragments. The lacelike appearance reveals influences as various as Indonesian shadow puppets and the printing methods of German Expressionism.The artist’s attraction to Coney Island derives from an all-American fascination with this place of wonder, magic, and bizarre personages. For Swoon, who was born in Florida, Coney Island encapsulates New York and its never-ending surprises, possibilities, and mystery.

 This tapered water jar with a highly polished black surface has a bear-paw motif on its neck. Alluding to the Santa Clara legend of a bear that led people to water in a time of drought, the bear paw is placed upright, as if in prayer asking for rain and everlasting life. The bands around the jar, referred to as rainbows, are also considered prayers, to keep the water from evaporating. According to Margaret Tafoya, the bear paw and rainbow designs are gifts from her Santa Clara ancestors. Esta jarra alargada de superficie negra bruñida tiene un motivo de garra de oso en el cuello. Aludiendo a la leyenda Santa Clara en la cual un oso condujo a la gente al agua en tiempo de sequía, la garra de oso está colocada hacia arriba, como en una plegaria pidiendo lluvia y vida eterna. Las franjas alrededor de la jarra, semejando un arcoíris, también se consideran plegarias, para prevenir que se evapore el agua. De acuerdo con Margaret Tafoya, los diseños de garra de oso y el arcoíris son regalos de sus ancestros Santa Clara.
 Yoram Wolberger’s sculpture of a Native American warrior belongs to a series of monumental versions of the plastic toy figurines that the artist used to stage elaborate mock battles between cowboys and Indians during his youth. Though infused with nostalgia, Red Indian #4 also invokes the violence that permeates both popular childhood games and the history of indigenous peoples in North America. To create his sculpture, Wolberger took molds of toy figurines—objects that were themselves based on stock images of Native Americans in nineteenth-century landscape paintings of America’s wilderness. Such imagery helped to foster perceptions among non-Natives of Indians as uncivilized, hostile, and an impediment to national progress defined by westward expansion. The irregular “fins” around the edges of Wolberger’s sculpture, which mimic the seams of their mass-produced toy counterparts, symbolize the continuing proliferation of standardized images of Native Americans and the American frontier. Moreover, the lack of detail and the generic character of his warrior underscore the ways in which stereotypes deny historical circumstances and ignore the diversity of Native peoples.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Damian Wampler’s series Darfur in Brooklyn, to which this image belongs, is an oblique portrait of a crisis. Brooklyn is home to more than three hundred Sudanese refugees, most of them living in the borough’s Kensington section, not far from Prospect Park. Through following one of them, the cab driver Omer Omar (shown here in his kitchen), for several months, Wampler presents a powerful portrait of the daily life of a little-known population in the Museum’s extended neighborhood.
 Arlene Shechet, a ceramicist and sculptor, also creates handmade papers from abacá, a plant native to the Philippines and prized for its delicate fibers. These works simultaneously make reference to the floor plans of Buddhist shrines, Japanese aizuri-e prints, and blue-and-white porcelain. The Flow Blue series, from which this work derives, is named after a particular type of British transfer pottery popular during the early nineteenth century. Modeled after Asian blue-and-white porcelain, these wares are known for their deliberately blurred forms mimicking the marbled appearance of lapis lazuli.

 Roxanne Swentzell’s work often plays on the interaction between native and non-native worlds. Here she uses clay, an ancient artistic medium, to depict a traditional Pueblo woman, whose face is much like Swentzell’s own. The woman in the sculpture looks up at the Santa Clara black pot balanced on her head, from which babies are emerging. But there is a contemporary ironic twist to what the woman is doing: is she “birthing” pots to be sold at an Indian market, or is it the baby Indians themselves that the consumer will want to buy? The work challenges the viewer to acknowledge the treatment of Native Americans as a stereotype and commodity in representations by non-natives in popular culture and advertising.
 Drawn to the creative energy of America’s ever-changing postwar city landscapes, the Athens-born Chryssa made a name for herself with work that utilized innovative materials taken from urban environments. During the 1960s she produced vibrant paintings, prints, and illuminated sculpture made of neon tubing, Plexiglas, and aluminum. The two sculptures shown here evoke Chryssa’s fascination with Times Square and celebrate the giant blinking, pulsing signs of the city. Her paintings and prints of the period, her Newspaper series of paintings in particular, are considered among the earliest Pop experiments with typography and print media.
 A play on geometric abstract painting, James Hyde’s piece utilizes everyday materials in place of pigment. The pairing of magenta and blue reflects the colors often found in the Madonna’s flowing gown as depicted in Renaissance altarpieces. The draped blue tarp could be seen as mimicking the way the fabric drapes around her feet.
 This photograph shows three women around a dining-room table, a symbol of a communal family ritual. But instead of facing each other, they are absorbed by their laptop computers. The women appear blurry and ghostlike, almost as if they have been transported to another world through the glowing screens. It is the inanimate physical objects throughout the room that come into view in detail, hinting at the transience of human existence as well as the sometimes alienating effects of contemporary communication. Pillsbury uses ambient lighting produced by the electronic devices that permeate our lives—such as televisions, computer screens, and cell phones—combined with long exposure times to create photographs that examine our relationships with these devices and the objects and people around us.
 Come Away from Her is based on a manuscript drawing by Lewis Carroll for his book Alice's Adventures Under Ground (1864). At this point in his story, friendly birds fly off when Alice talks about what her cat likes to eat. In Kiki Smith's prints based on fairytales, childhood vulnerability and innocence like Alice's can be imbued with a sense of the sexual awakening that accompanies adolescence, and the animals sometimes shown with young girls suggest underlying forces of nature. Here we witness a cryptic scene, as Alice watches winged forms, some of them with incongruous limbs, fly away from her.
 Dale Chihuly is the best-known glass artist in the United States. Trained at the University of Wisconsin and the Rhode Island School of Design, he received the first Fulbright Fellowship in glass and went to Venice in 1968 to study at Venini, the most progressive glass factory in Italy. In 1971 he established the Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle, the only American art school devoted entirely to glassmaking. His affinity for the Northwest is profound; he has strong ties to the landscape and great interest in the arts of the native peoples there. This particular work was inspired by the traditional woven baskets of the Haida and other Northwest Coast tribes.Chihuly has moved from small-scale vases of recognizable form to art that transcends the boundaries of traditional glassmaking. As this "basket" demonstrates, he has abandoned functionalism in favor of large sculptural forms. Often he and his assistants work on a grand scale, creating large environments composed of many thousands of glass elements for specific sites. In 1994, he created Brooklyn Wall, a temporary installation in the Museum's lobby.
 This blown-glass sculpture has a red and black design, the two signature colors for Northwest Coast art. It represents a killer whale, one of the crest designs of the Tlingit glass-blower Preston Singletary. The surface incorporates traditional form-line designs with the black outlining the positive, primary spaces and the deeply cut red shaping the negative, secondary spaces of the whale's body. This reflects the same style of design used in traditional mediums such as totem poles, Tlingit Chilkat blankets, rattles, and other ritual paraphernalia. All such artworks reflect visual histories and designs owned by hereditary right by each Native artist.Singletary trained at the famous Pilchuck Glass School in Seattle with glass artists such as Lino Tagliapetra and Cicco Ongaro but credits the Isleta Pueblo glassblower Tony Jojola with inspiring him to switch from making European-style works to creating from within his own Tlingit culture. Singletary has become the leader of a rapidly developing, innovative Native American glass art movement.
 ART OF POWERAlthough art has historically glorified the powerful, it can also be a means of communication and expression for those without power. These Congolese works represent opposite ends of the social spectrum. The mwaash aMbooy mask is emblematic of royal power and prestige for the Kuba kingdom of the central Congo. It represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba trace their descent, and is worn only by the king (nyim) or by local chiefs. In both its dance and as a sculpture, it is a vision of gravity and composure. The contemporary portraits by Aimé Mpane, in turn, depict the struggles of those without access to power. They show ordinary citizens of Kinshasa, along with representations of their fears and desires. The artist carves these images from plywood, turning two-dimensional surfaces into works filled with light and shadow (suggesting both presence and absence) that animate the stories of the dispossessed.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.

 In Japan, Raku ware (Raku-yaki) is usually associated with the tea ceremony. It developed during the Momoyama period (1573â1615) when the first generation of the Raku family is said to have made tea bowls for Sen no Rikyū (1522â1591), the renowned tea master. Raku ware was once restricted to ceramics specifically made by the Raku family, but today its techniques are widely used.
 Shigaraki ware is associated with tea bowls and other utensils for the tea ceremony. However, the technique was first utilized to produce tiles for the roof of Shigaraki palace, which was built for Emperor Shōmu (reigned 724–49) of the Tenpyō period. Later, during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the technique was used for utilitarian vessels, including water jars, large pots, and farming implements. Only after the Muromachi period (1392–1573) was Shigaraki ware used for tea bowls.
 Ido ware was first made as inexpensive rice bowls in fifteenth-century Korea. When Ido ware was imported to Japan, people started to employ it for the tea ceremony, and Ido tea bowls were highly respected. The attraction of this example is its powerful form, featuring a relatively tall footed base in the shape of a bamboo stem, and its glaze pattern, which resemble the dry skin of an old plum tree.
 Shino ware was produced in the Mino area of Japan (in modern Gifu prefecture near Nagoya) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1574–1600), mainly for the tea ceremony. Shino glazes, which are always thick, come in shades of red or gray, but white is the most popular. White Shino tea bowls were in high demand among tea masters, as the white color expresses purity and is considered a perfect presentation of the spirit of the tea ceremony.
 Kohiki ware was brought to Japan from Korea, where it was known as Punch'ong ware. It takes its name from the Japanese for "ground powder," an allusion to the ware's powder-fine glaze. Kohiki ware tea bowls, famous for their deep bodies, were admired by samurai warriors of the late sixteenth century who relished the tea ceremony.
 By the time Brooklyn-based Lorna Simpson completed her M.F.A. at the University of California, San Diego, in 1985, she was already gaining recognition for her large-scale photographs focusing on the female African American figure. Subtly addressing issues of racial and gender identity in American society, she juxtaposed text with her photographs, continually presenting her female subject as anonymous by hiding part of her face or choosing a view of the figure’s back. Thus the viewer never knew these women as individuals. In Counting, Simpson presents us with three images: an African American woman, a brick hut, and braids. As in most of her work, the meaning is open-ended, but the adjacent texts suggest that the work deals with labor and slavery. The woman is paired with time slots that could imply work shifts. Text alluding to the beginning of slavery appears with a Southern smokehouse once used as a slave hut. The image of braids coupled with the text “25 twists, 70 braids, 50 locks” implies the arrangement of multiple, intricate braids, a cultural trait sometimes associated with African American women.
 Wishing Well is Thomas Woodruff’s meditation on the ravages of the AIDS epidemic rendered in the style of an Old Master painting. The initials of the artist’s departed friends are inscribed on the work, which follows the composition of the central panel of the Adoration of the Lamb from the famous Ghent Altarpiece, completed by Hubert and Jan van Eyck in 1432. Echoing the paradisical scene, with its references to the sacrificial lamb of the Crucifixion and the fountain of life, Woodruff places a plentitude of apples, birds, and rabbits around a wishing well. As in the proverb “an apple a day,” the apples suggest the possibility of healing and overcoming the menace of AIDS through hope, joy, and appreciation of the everyday miracles of life. This painting was the central piece of the artist’s exhibition Apple Canon, where it was installed with 365 images of various kinds of apples depicted with the precision of Flemish genre painting.
 The buildup of pigment and modeling clay on the velvet surface of Rockets Redglare in Paradise exemplifies the intense materiality of Julian Schnabel’s paintings from the early 1980s, a decade that saw a revived interest in the medium of painting and in expressionist brushwork. Reminiscing in 1996, Schnabel recalled that he had encountered Michael Morra, a well-known downtown actor and standup comedian whose stage name was Rockets Redglare (taken from “The Star-Spangled Banner”), on his way to see the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. When Schnabel heard that Basquiat planned to make a painting of Rockets, Schnabel invited the performer to his studio instead and subsequently created this likeness.
 When Astroland first opened in 1962, it included two of the classic Coney Island rides: the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel (left of center in this image). In 2006 the owners sold Astroland to a developer who had already assembled a large amount of land in Coney Island’s old amusement area. A short-term lease will allow Astroland to reopen next summer, but as this text goes to press, it remains unclear whether the developer’s plan for towering hotels, shops, restaurants, movie theaters, and high-tech entertainment will be accepted or rebuffed by city authorities.In the past few years, attempts to revitalize Coney Island have increased; KeySpan Park and the new Stillwell Avenue subway station are the most obvious examples. While many agree that rejuvenation is necessary, voices have been raised against the prospect of turning Coney Island into a gentrified enclave for the well-off. New York City’s creation of a Coney Island Development Corporation in 2003 brought together city officials as well as local business and community leaders. This initiative indicated awareness of the importance of caring for the area’s traditional qualities and of keeping it available to a diverse audience while providing a wide-ranging plan for economic development that would include a year-round amusement district as well as many new residential opportunities. At this moment, it is uncertain what the result of these efforts will be.
 The rise of Coney Island in the postwar years was temporary, and from the 1950s, Coney was in steady decline. Postwar suburbanization, car culture, and the creation of parkways and public state parks such as Jones Beach offered people alternatives for day trips in the summer. Robert Moses, New York City’s powerful Parks Commissioner, objected to the kind of entertainment Coney offered with its penny arcades, shooting galleries, rides, and sideshows. In 1938 his Parks Department took control of the beach at Coney Island, with efforts to increase public access and reduce the amusements. In the 1950s and 1960s large areas were used for new housing projects built on Moses’s initiative. Widespread gang violence in the 1950s frightened some visitors, and when Steeplechase closed for good in 1964, the area dedicated to amusement was dramatically reduced. Nevertheless, Coney Island as a democratic destination for everyone subsisted, as testified here in Stephen Salmieri’s many images from the late 1960s.
 Ana Mendieta: Place and PresenceBefore graduating from the University of Iowa in 1972, Ana Mendieta had already embarked upon her unique practice of blending photography, body art, earth art, and performance art as she addressed the emergence of feminism and her experience as a Cuban exile.For her iconic Silueta series, Mendieta placed her body in the landscape, using materials such as crushed flowers, sculpted mud, or ignited gunpowder to literally inscribe her silhouette, and then documented the ephemeral results through photographs and films. Returning to Cuba in 1980 and 1981, she continued to trace female forms on the ground, as in the pieces executed on the beach in Guanabo. She also began carving fertility figures into the caves and cliffs of her native land, which she called Rupestrian Sculptures. Many of these, such as the large Untitled (Guanaroca [First Woman]), were named after indigenous goddesses, simultaneously serving as political and personal assertions of Mendieta’s presence and identity, as well as reminders of ancient traditions of goddess worship.
 This is a monumental elegy for the Irish Republican Army member and long-term prisoner Mairead Farrell, who, along with two unarmed male companions, was shot to death at close range in 1988, in Gibraltar, by the British Security Service. The ghostly text in the upper right—“Your mind is your strongest weapon because they can’t control your mind they can’t get inside and that’s their failure”—was taken from one of Farrell’s last interviews. Doogan’s concentration on the female martyr is in keeping with her long-standing interest in depicting the female body with a clear-eyed realism and care worthy of Renaissance masters such as Albrecht Dürer, evident in the sensuous drapery that shrouds the martyr and the blood that seeps from her ear into the water below.
 In the wake of its humiliating defeat at the hands of Prussia in 1870, the French Third Republic sought to reinvigorate notions of heroism and citizenship. To this end, in 1884 the city council of Calais commissioned Rodin to create a monument to Eustache de Saint-Pierre. In 1347, while Calais was under siege by the English, Eustache and five other important citizens of the town had offered themselves as hostages, pleading for mercy for their long-suffering city.In his first maquette of 1884, Rodin proposed a conventional monument, with his figures united as a group on a tall pedestal. By the following year, however, the six figures were placed on a low rectangular plinth, at the same level as the viewer. As Rodin later wrote: "I wanted to have my statues placed in front of the Calais city hall on the very paving of the square like a living rosary of suffering and sacrifice."Rodin first made nude figure studies, which he then draped in wet canvas to model the sackcloth worn by the burghers when they surrendered. To create the expressive figures possible, he used the radical technique of combining studies of hands and feet from different figures. Creating the very antithesis of conventional heroic sculpture, Rodin here set out the terms of a modern, anti-monumental tradition that resonates to this day.
 These two works are part of a large series of soldiers’ portraits by the New York–based photographer Suzanne Opton. Opton photographed Claxton and Mickelson on their return to Fort Drum, New York, from service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Asking each to rest his head on a table, she shot the horizontal face close up, against a dark background. The images of these disembodied heads reveal every pore and blemish, even a wandering eyelash. Psychological portraits more than traditional representations of heroes, the exposed faces seem thoughtful and oddly tranquil, vulnerable in their naked intimacy.

 Sarah Hobbs explores the world of phobias and aspects of erratic human behavior in her constructed environments. Untitled (Eggs) is one of a number of works by the artist that focus on an obsessive gathering of selected objects. Here the viewer is drawn into the image by the seeming perfection of the eggs, which on closer examination reveal extensive flaws and cracks. Because the objects are presented approximately life-size, they relate directly to human scale, but humans are eerily absent from this photograph and similar works by the artist.
In Steffani Jemison’s Personal, three black men— professional actors based in Brooklyn who responded to an ad Jemison placed—move improvisationally through various locations in Bed-Stuy. Shot against an unfinished mural, in a public park, and on a playing field, the actors walk forward, backward, and in slow circles, with the world around them largely unaffected by their movement. Jemison moves between letting the footage play naturally and reversing it, making it unclear if the action is unfolding in real time or not. Techniques of repetition and reversal confuse time, space, and sequence. These strategies provoke viewers to consider the impact of inherited narratives and question notions of linear progress, particularly in relation to black Americans.
 Like much of Wangechi Mutu's work, Eat Cake focuses on a female protagonist: here, a mysterious woman (played by Mutu) with unkempt hair, clawlike nails, and translucent platform heels. Materializing at water's edge against a soundtrack of tinkling bells and birdcalls, she squats before a multitiered chocolate cake and then messily devours it. Hunched over and swaying, she appears both primal and enchanted. The woman's decadent clothing and voracious appetite invite reflection on our separation from the natural world and patterns of excessive consumption, while her ritualistic movements suggest an attempt to reconnect with both the earthly and spirit realms of the forest around her. Placed on the floor, Eat Cake forces us to bend over or even squat, mimicking the woman’s position and, perhaps, also that of women in society at large.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 
 With this work, the Brooklyn Museum debuts the recent acquisition of a significant collection of artworks from the Black Arts Movement, considered the cultural wing of the Black Power Movement in the late 1960s and 1970s. Nelson Stevens was a member of the Chicago-based collective AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists). AfriCOBRA used what they called “coolade colors” to create empowering images of African Americans—which they deemed “Superreal images for Superreal people.” Here a woman with an afro (then a highly political hairstyle) casts her gaze upward, as if envisioning a day when African Americans would be truly free. The word uhuru means “freedom” in Swahili, and the choice of language signaled the group’s Afrocentric politics.
 In this mixed-media collage, Ralph Arnold, a participant in the Black Arts Movement in Chicago, combined what may seem to be disparate images of politics and sports. The photograph at the lower center of the canvas shows a very young Julian Bond, then a leader of the civil rights organization Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The images of football players layered against the montage of black men marching and soldiering may also be a commentary on racial equality, since the artist created this collage at a moment when the National Football League, an organization slow to integrate, merged with the American Football League, which recruited from historically black colleges and universities.
 The artist states, "This painting is from a group of on-site works of the same location, executed at the same time of day, sunset, over the period of one year. Together they function as a set of mug shots of the place where victims of three unrelated murders were found over the previous year. One evening, as I was painting in my car, a crowd of spectators began to gather along the levee across the road. With toddlers perched on their shoulders and small children jumping at their sides, parents elbowed for an unobstructed view of officials pulling the waterlogged body of a man, victim #4, from the Trinity River [outside Fort Worth, Texas]."
 In these two photographs from the 1990s, Anthony Randell captures the atmosphere in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as DUMBO (short for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) before its gentrification. The area was developed as a manufacturing district, close to the Fulton Ferry landing, in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. In the wake of the de-industrialization of the Brooklyn waterfront, artists moved into the decaying district in the 1970s in search of large studio space and cheap rents. Over the past fifteen years, developers converted many of the old buildings to luxury apartments and turned the waterfront into an attractive park. While the area today is thriving, most artists have been forced to move to less expensive Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Bushwick and Sunset Park.

 In this drawing Duke Riley presents real and imagined accounts about the original residents as well as an imaginary group of contemporary inhabitants of Mill Rock Island, a small, inhospitable strip of land just north of Roosevelt Island in the East River of New York. Initially named Bright Passage or Hell Gate by Dutch explorers, the island and the river become a mythical place in Riley’s densely rendered scenes. Influenced by tattoo art as well as woodcuts and nineteenth-century whaling art, this large-scale drawing invites the viewer to find hidden treasures and stories depicting tales of sexual exploits with pirates, mermaids and other mythical creatures. Part of Riley’s vast multimedia project East River Incognita 1, The Bright Passage further evokes the ambiguous line between history and myth by including fragments and landmarks of contemporary life in New York.
 Sol LeWitt, active from the 1960s, was a pioneer of Minimalism and Conceptual art. He often worked with simple geometric forms—particularly the cube—straight lines, and ninety-degree angles. Hanging Structure’s suspended three-dimensional grid, composed of identical, monochromatic units, is emblematic of this interest. In contrast, Terence Koh, inspired by queer, punk, and DIY cultures, belongs to a 1990s generation whose work is more personally inflected. Embracing decay and ephemerality, Untitled (Vitrines) displays whitewashed objects collected from friends, lovers, Koh’s childhood, and flea markets, acting almost as a shrine preserving relics from his life. The sculpture departs significantly from LeWitt’s strict vision yet engages with the legacies of Minimalism and Conceptual art, exploring the possibilities of the grid and the monochrome and extending those formal considerations into the personal realm.
 Kiki Smith is known for her ongoing engagement with bodily matter and the female form, often through fairy tales and folklore. The title of the set to which this lithograph belongs—Banshee Pearls—combines terms with very different connotations. Pearls have long signified upper-class elegance and femininity, while a banshee is a female spirit in Irish mythology whose chilling screams and ghostlike pallor are omens of death. The word banshee is still used to describe women or girls who are seen as wild or inappropriately behaved. Here, repeating deathlike masks of a woman’s face ask the viewer to consider how female powerrelates to beauty and the grotesque.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 Titi in Window and Luis’s Mother are part of a series of works completed by John Ahearn and his collaborator, Rigoberto Torres, in the Longwood neighborhood of the South Bronx. Starting in 1979 and continuing throughout the 1980s, a time when this community was struggling economically and socially, Ahearn and Torres created plaster castings of their neighbors and friends. The two sculptors would often cast their subjects on the sidewalk, and then display the finished busts publicly on walls in the neighborhood.

 Throughout her career, Louise Bourgeois experimented with various methods of representing body fragments in her sculptures. Many of them employ roughly finished marble blocks, with the exquisitely carved figurative elements seamlessly growing from the stone mass. Hands appear frequently among these pieces. As the most important tool of the artist, hands are celebrated in many forms. They are expressive of character and mood, and serve in the process of communication. The two finely carved hands in Décontractée appear in a moving gesture that suggests the relaxation and release that might follow a painful experience.
 Alec Soth creates a visual record of America. In his series Sleeping by the Mississippi, he depicts not only the people and places that make up life along the river, but also the shift in culture as the river flows from north to south. Soth presents these photographs as a fragmented narrative, a rambling sequence of images similar to the flow of dream imagery or the currents of the unconscious. With his interest in the representation of the United States and its inhabitants, his portraits express a wide range of feelings, from pride to loneliness and vulnerability.This image shows a man bundled in workman’s clothes against a bleak rural landscape; he presents model airplanes to the viewer, as if explaining a project. With its implicit references to the iconic American aviator Charles Lindbergh (whose unassuming boyhood bed is shown in another photograph in the group) and to the very idea of America (in the colors and emblematic stars and stripes on one of the planes), the image is both an intimate, personal portrait of a man and his toys and a link to the rest of the series.
 This image is part of the photographer Harvey Wang’s photographic series of endangered occupations. A testament to New York City’s rapid changes, it is not only a document of a vanishing chapter of the city’s history but also an intimate portrayal of the people who held these jobs: mannequin makers, pillow makers, and scrap-metal collectors. Coney’s Cyclone roller coaster no longer has a brakeman.
 William Hawkings was born in eastern Kentucky at the end of the nineteenth century. When he was two years old, his mother died, and Hawkings was sent to live on his grandparents' farm. Although he moved to Columbus, Ohio, as a young man, much of his work depicts idyllic agrarian life, the memories of his childhood. Self-taught as an artist, Hawkins could not afford to purchase commercial frames for his paintings, and he typically painted a decorative border around his pictures.
 In this image, Willie Cole uses an iron to connect with painful and lingering histories of racial oppression, commenting on the extent to which the marks of the past live on in the present. The iron, which left a singed impression in the middle panel, suggests domestic service (Cole’s mother and grandmother both worked as housekeepers), but its form also recalls both the European ships that carried captive African laborers to the Americas and historical African masks.In the first and third panels, Cole superimposes the iron-as-mask image over his own face. By connecting a suggestion of iron marks to his face in the first panel, Cole further evokes the manner in which history has marked his body. He suggests both ritual scarification patterns and the branding irons that turned the bodies of African laborers into Western commodities.
 In the late sixties I was thinking about the triumph of the Cuban people over imperialism and U.S. dominance—the effort is here "crowned" (Corona). But Corona is also a famous cigar from Havana that is desired (and now missed) by affluent Yankees—so struggle, victory, and contradictions are part of the idea. I was working my way out of a more lyrical and abstract view of figuration at the time toward a more socially-politically oriented idiom, hoping to find a way to maintain a formally strong image. . . . This painting is in transition. . . . The form is evolving toward artistic and social relevancy. The painting has particular interest to me since it straddles these objectives and balances precariously, one foot in each world.

 Sadegh Tirafkan explores the layering of traditional and modern Iranian culture and the conflicts between Iranian and western culture in his photographs, collages, and video installations. In this photograph, the first portrait in a series entitled The Loss of Our Identity, the artist presents the viewer with a portrait of an Iranian youth in a white T-shirt with headphones, both attributes of western culture. His eyes, however, are hidden beneath a superimposed “curtain” created from a reproduction of a battle scene illustrated in a Qajar period Persian lithographed book. The image seems to question the deterioration of traditional Iranian culture in the face of an increasingly superficial world driven by new media. Tirafkan belongs to a group of contemporary Muslim artists whose work is increasingly sought by collectors and museums in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The Brooklyn Museum is proud to present this work as the first contemporary addition to its Arts of the Islamic World collection.
 Despite its having the mane of a male lion, the female body and attributes identify this striding figure as Sakhmet, whose name literally means “The Powerful One,” or another lion-headed goddess. Her attributes include a sun disk and uraeus (rearing cobra) on her head, which together connect her with the sun god Re and emphasize her roles as his daughter, the “Eye of the Sun” and protector of the king. The papyrus scepter in her left hand evokes regeneration and rebirth, among her divine responsibilities.
 Betty Woodman, the doyenne of American studio ceramics, has had a keen interest in the art of antiquity and other cultures since the beginning of her career in the 1950s. Here she has transposed the form of an ancient Japanese ceremonial bronze bell known as the dotaku into terra-cotta and then covered the handbuilt bell with a lustrous glaze, terra sigillata, inspired by ancient Roman redware.
 Converting found materials into a unique medium between sculpture and painting, El Anatsui combines diverse aesthetic traditions from Ghana, Nigeria, and the global history of abstraction. Working with discarded metal bottle caps collected from a liquor distillery, Anatsui modifies this unremarkable everyday material, chosen for both its physical qualities and its bodily connection to the original consumer, to make vast, undulating sheets. Anatsui’s sheets are pieced together and hung without prescribed orientation, taking on new shapes with each installation. This “non-fixed form,” as the artist calls it, is emblematic of Anatsui’s desire for his work to remain dynamic, inspiring creativity in those who install it and illustrating the ever-changing conditions of life.In Black Block, Anatsui uses only one color (though the black is broken up by flashes of red and yellow) and only one type of metal piece across a monumental expanse of some 15,000 elements.
 In this serene painting, Emmi Whitehorse achieves a unique balance between her modern art training and her Native heritage. Born and raised on the Navajo reservation, she lived with her grandmother and was surrounded by Navajo stories and cultural traditions. For Whitehorse, the Southwest landscape is her identity and the source of her inspiration. In this painting, loosely formed abstractions fill the surface and float in a hazy, fluid medium that could be a mirage of heat or a sandstone cliff. The floating, abstract shapes resemble seeds, pods, and roots of plants, imagery that also relates to Navajo weaving, in which plants are used as dye sources. As a child, Whitehorse collected plants with her grandmother, who hung them on the walls of their house to dry. That is the origin of the floating vegetal forms.
In his diverse body of work, Roxy Paine often deals with nature and artifice, particularly the tension between natural processes and the constructed environment. Encased in a glass box with a wooden floor and frames, the replica of a Datura plant in this piece has been domesticated. With leaves half-devoured by insects, it looks deceptively harmless—and still quite beautiful—in its decaying state. Nevertheless, the Datura is a dangerously poisonous plant. It contains scopolamine and atropine, which in very low doses can be used both as medications and as powerful hallucinogens, transporting the user to otherworldly states of consciousness. Yet, an overdose of these substances is fatal.
 Fritz Scholder, ambivalent about identifying himself as a Native American artist, often chose an objective stance in portraying Native subjects. This lithograph belongs to a series in which he challenged stereotypical perceptions of the Indian as noble, pure, and a symbol of wisdom. Standing inert with an indecipherable expression, the figure nevertheless exudes a strange power, waiting for something the viewer can only guess.
 What is Native American art and who is a Native American artist? The artist Fritz Scholder referred to himself as a non-Indian Indian, someone who never felt the pull of two different cultures. With this lithograph series he challenges popular stereotypical depictions of Indians as stoic, noble, pure, and the embodiment of wisdom. Instead, he offers an amorphous human form, showing only a scruffy face with an open mouth, though the hint of a warrior breastplate, the wrapped braids, and the sharply angled feather suggest a Native American identity. The figure’s tightly wrapped blanket and his turned pose seem to reject empathy from the viewer.
 Fritz Scholder’s imagery in paintings and prints frequently explores atypical views of Native American life. Most depictions of this subject feature the vibrant colors of the regalia and the swirling action of the Buffalo dancers, performing in celebration of their past. Instead, Scholder offers a somber depiction of the haunted soul of a man with hollow eyes. His vacant stare implies that the past is dead, the present is empty, and the future cannot be envisioned.
 Fritz Scholder’s imagery in paintings and prints frequently explores the cultural contradictions of late twentieth-century Native American life. He often shows harsh realities but sometimes presents a humorous view, as in this lithograph, in which warriors on horseback carry non-native, innocuously jaunty umbrellas. This seemingly improbable scene is actually taken from real life; umbrellas have been used by both men and women as protection from the hot sun on the Plains since the late nineteenth century.
 Helen Levitt's photograph of two children on a New York street is a wonderful example of her prolific engagement with street life. The capacity to transform the documentary into poetry, to interpret a scene on the street from a humanistic perspective and give it a new meaning, is a key feature of Brooklyn-born Levitt's lifelong photographic practice, always more artistic than journalistic.  The seemingly simple structure of this image reveals a skillful sense of composition. The graffiti and the many layers of advertisements on the back wall echo the black scribbles on the face of the boy on the left, his vertically striped pants juxtaposed with the horizontal bands of the wall in the background. Quietly and full of concentration, he is gazing at the other boy, slightly out of focus, carefully handling a bubble.Levitt studied with Walker Evans in New York in the late 1930s and began photographing city children in the 1940s, always imbuing her subjects with characteristic warmth. In 1970, she was one of the first street photographers to begin working in color.
 Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1911, Romare Bearden moved with his family to New York City in 1915, where in the 1930s he attended New York University, studied art with George Grosz at the Art Students League, and joined artists' groups associated with the Harlem Renaissance. While maintaining his strong connection with New York, Bearden frequently returned to his grandparents' house in North Carolina for the summer, and memories of the South were to inspire many of his works, such as Southern Courtyard.
 Kara Walker has succeeded in developing a signature visual vocabulary that is instantly recognizable for its engagement with both nineteenth-century imaging techniques and the historical period of the American antebellum South. In Keys to the Coop, Walker depicts a young African American girl in bold silhouette, holding the decapitated head of a chicken in one hand, while in the other she nonchalantly twirls a large key. Walker portrays a self-empowered anti-heroine who possesses the key to her own salvation, in stark black-and-white. This image also provocatively alludes to food, gender, and racial mythologies, subjects that Walker often foregrounds in her work.
 This print evokes one of the key visual metaphors associated with Kali, who is sometimes depicted as pure geometric abstraction, in the form of a yantra, rather than as a multilimbed goddess. Yantras are spiritual visualization instruments specific to the philosophy and ritual of Tantra, a sect of both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Kali yantra is a red and black diagram of interlocking triangles, lotus petals, and geometric forms, and is one of several symbolic representations of shakti (female divine energy). The inverted triangle also resonates with the contemporary use of pink and black triangles as symbols of queer identity.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 This large-scale painting is one in an ongoing Collaboration series begun in the mid-1970s, in which Schapiro dialogues with and pays homage to famous women artists, in this instance Frida Kahlo, whose self-portrait The Broken Column, 1944, is reproduced in the center. Schapiro is a pioneering feminist artist who, with Judy Chicago, founded the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, the first program of its kind to encourage women to make art from their personal experiences. A leader in the Pattern and Decoration movement, Schapiro is known for her “femmages,” or collage paintings, which aim to reclaim traditional handicrafts associated with women’s work, such as embroidery and sewing. Stylistically this painting mimics the look of a collage, recalling Schapiro’s long-standing commitment to the belief that decorative elements and women’s work are viable artistic means to express female experience, having both political and subversive potential.
 This water jar of classic Pueblo shape by Marcellus and Elizabeth Toya Medina, a husband and wife team, illustrates both the old and the new. Circling the jar, in the background, are depictions of traditional masked Kachinas who perform in religious ceremonies. Bursting into dance in front of these figures are naturalistic, muscled, male Pueblo dancers in very active dance positions, also wearing traditional regalia.
 Vija Celmins derives many of her images from photographs and is particularly interested in translating three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional surfaces. Internationally known for her intensely realistic renditions of natural environments, the artist here also conveys a sense of abstraction and illusion. Celmins recently turned her attention to spiderwebs after making images of bodies of water, skies, and sandy deserts for many years. “Maybe I identify with the spider,” she once stated. “I’m the kind of person who works on something forever and then works on the same image again the next day.”
 Sylvia Plimack Mangold's The Inversion is full of polarities: images compete with a void, geometry conflicts with nature, traditional landscape painting faces off against abstraction. The artist began The Inversion as a larger work, and it forms a narrative about the painting process: "The landscape originally stretched horizontally from left to right, side to side," she wrote. "I cropped it because it didn't work—the negation of some areas becomes a positive element in the support of the total picture." In other words, the void at the right is a kind of negative "inversion" of the positive landscape.
 Cindy Sherman’s reputation was built on the success of her Untitled Film Stills, a series of black-and-white photographs from the late 1970s in which the artist depicted herself in various typecast roles of the Hollywood heroine. In that series, she described how the male gaze reduces the female subject to stereotype. The series Fairy Tales and Disasters of the mid- to late 1980s marked a major shift in Sherman’s self-representation. External appearance became the means by which to explore the contents of an internal world, one influenced by fairytales, myths, and fantasy. If the Untitled Film Stills expressed a sense of anxiety about the lurking male gaze, then the Fairy Tales, such as this one, reveal a monstrous “other” we all carry inside. The harsh, sickly greenish-yellow lighting emphasizes the slobbering lips, decaying teeth, and tense fists of this character. The vulnerable girls and alluring temptresses of the Film Stills are replaced by grotesque figures emerging from some netherworld.
 My mother had the idea to shoot a portrait of me wearing this T-shirt printed with a Huxtable family portrait. As a child I watched The Cosby Show in order to escape the reality of my dismantled working-class family. My mother set up the camera in the bedroom doorway, facing a mirror reflecting part of her image. Both the mirror and the T-shirt are scratched, dusty, and fading in the light. In the text that I perform live, for this particular photograph I wrote, “Between my background and my foreground, I am not sure where I stand.”—LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 I found out in 2008 that both Grandma Ruby and Mom had cancer, as did many of the elder women in Braddock. Here, Mom and I explored a new approach to documenting our illnesses (mine being lupus). We stood our mattress on end and covered it with a comforter, essentially making it our studio/stage. We made a portrait of our bodies overlapping as one, unified in sickness, death, and our struggle to survive. The light cast a shadow that for me foreshadows the loss of Grandma Ruby; she passed away six months later from pancreatic cancer. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 In Self-Portrait (March 10 a.m.) I continued to document my lupus attacks. Any time I am having a lupus attack and feel up to making a portrait, I document the moment. On this occasion I had just returned from clearing out my grandmother’s apartment in Braddock after her death. I only kept a few articles of her clothing. In this portrait I am wearing her pajama pants, and a bed sheet is duct-taped to the bedroom wall. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 Although now known primarily as a landscape painter, Sylvia Plimack Mangold engaged in the realistic depiction of domestic interiors until the mid-1970s. In this painting she painstakingly describes the geometry created by a patterned parquet floor strewn with articles of clothing. Using exaggerated perspective, the artist leads us into the depth of space, implying the large scale of the room. In contrast to the elaborately set up interiors that were the subject of paintings through the nineteenth century, Mangold presents a segment of a modern household where everyone is rushing, and tidying up is the last thing on anyone's mind.
 Gordon Matta-Clark is best known for his “building cuts,” turning buildings into sculptural environments by carving through floors, walls, and ceilings. He dubbed these site-specific transformations “Anarchitecture” (a combination of “anarchy” and “architecture”); they were documented in films and photographs that were subsequently exhibited in galleries, sometimes alongside sections of the cut-out buildings. In connection with his Super 8mm film Underground Paris (1977), exploring the complex underground spaces of the city, Matta-Clark made a series of photographic works of the same title. These represent another type of cut, this time deep into the ground, where the built environment is contrasted with the city’s many buried stories. In Underground Paris: St. Michel, Matta-Clark photographed the catacombs beneath the center of Paris and created a larger image by combining many smaller photographs, often making visible the edges of the strips of negatives. This montage of several similar-looking images, both color and black and white, refers back to the Super 8mm film, taking a form like a filmstrip. At the same time, the horizontal seams between the images allude to geological layers, just as the work’s extreme vertical format mimics the descending movement necessary to reach these hidden and forgotten burial grounds. The city is visible above, with its roofline and the highlighted silhouette of a church emphasizing the contrast between past and present.
 Made in the year of Ralph Ellison’s death, Black Monolith II (For Ralph Ellison) is an homage to the author of Invisible Man that expands the possibilities of painting. It is part of a larger series by Jack Whitten honoring black visionaries in politics and the arts, many of whom (including Ellison) Whitten knew. To create this mosaic-like painting, Whitten made tiles composed of organic materials and acrylic paint and applied them to a canvas. The tiles each have a unique chemistry, with embedded materials that are symbolic. According to Whitten, the figure’s acrylic-encased razor-blade mouth references the “double edge of black identity,” which “cuts both ways.” The illumination radiating from the figure alludes to one of Whitten’s favorite sentences in Invisible Man: “The truth is the light and the light is the truth.”
 Simon Norfolk’s Israeli Sniper Wall depicts a border zone: a wall built between the Israeli settlement of Gilo, outside Jerusalem, and an adjacent Palestinian village, to protect Israeli settlers from gunfire. To brighten the view on the Israeli side, the wall has been painted with a landscape, the view as it would have been without the Palestinian village on the opposite side. The elegant composition, muted colors, and smooth tonalities of the photograph add to its almost otherworldly character. Norfolk's use of an old-fashioned mahogany and brass field camera—a large-format view camera with a slow shutter speed—also contributes to the epic quality of the image: a beauty in conflict, or at least in jarring juxtaposition, with the problematic subject at hand. Norfolk's extraordinary ability to fuse the timeless and the topical resonates with the Museum’s great collection of landscape paintings steeped in meaning, most notably the “Great Pictures” of the American West, such as Alfred Bierstadt’s A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie (1863).
 In many of his staged photographs, William Wegman uses his dogs in playful and surprising ways. At first glance October 1981, Rangeley, Maine looks like a mere forest, but further inspection reveals a weimaraner camouflaged by the foliage. Wegman’s image mischievously evokes fairy tales, fantasies, and legends, in which the forest has traditionally been used as a backdrop, and the dog emerges from the forest in disguise like a canine Robin Hood.
 Su Xiaobai engages both Western abstraction and the traditional Chinese medium of lacquer in creating this painting, at once translucent and luminous, opaque and furrowed. Su has said that this painting was inspired by Buddhist philosophy and Ming and Qing dynasty blue-and-white porcelains.
 In Liberty, Hank Willis Thomas renders a two-dimensional image as a three-dimensional sculpture. The original photograph appeared in Life Magazine in 1986 and featured a Harlem Globetrotter in front of the Statue of Liberty, spinning a basketball on his finger. Interested in popular culture, photographic history, and sports as a metaphor for individual and collective struggle, Thomas created a lifesize sculpture of the moment by casting the arm of retired NBA All-Star Juwan Howard. Liberty is part of Thomas’s Punctum series, which draws inspiration from the French philosopher Roland Barthes’s idea of the punctum: that “element which rises from the [photographic] scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces.” Using this concept as his foundation, Thomas selects a specific area of an image and re-presents it as sculpture. Through cropping and isolation, he encourages us to contemplate framing itself: what is left in or out of a photograph, narrative, or account of a historical event, and why?
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.

 Painting is about the world that we live in. Black men live in the world. My choice is to include them. This is my way of saying yes to us. -Kehinde Wiley Historically, the role of portraiture has been not only to create a likeness but also to communicate ideas about the subject's status, wealth, and power. During the eighteenth century, for example, major patrons from the church and the aristocracy commissioned portraits in part to signify their importance in society. This portrait imitates the posture of the figure of Napoleon Bonaparte in Jacques-Louis David's painting Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at Grand-Saint-Bernard. Wiley transforms the traditional equestrian portrait by substituting an anonymous young Black man dressed in contemporary clothing for the figure of Napoleon. The artist thereby confronts and critiques historical traditions that do not acknowledge Black cultural experience. Wiley presents a new brand of portraiture that redefines and affirms Black identity and simultaneously questions the history of Western painting.
 Homeless Hungry Homo comments on how gay Africans are . . . oftentimes more likely to end up in poverty because of the dual criminalization and demonization of same-sex love, by the government and the church respectively. It also comments on the fear of poverty as a result of coming out, and the notion that people will choose to remain “masked” and in the closet for that reason.— Adejoke TugbiyeleTragically, the sort of binary-free, autonomous space artists like Jacolby Satterwhite celebrate is not always available, particularly in parts of contemporary Africa. Adejoke Tugbiyele’s art advocates for richer and more humane understandings of identity and status, particularly with regard to sexual orientation.Here, Tugbiyele takes discarded and low-value materials, including palm stems, and weaves them into a figure imbued with the colors of the gay pride flag. At the same time, the figure sits in a gesture that evokes a life lived on the streets and wears a mask to conceal the subject’s identity.
 This cabinet exemplifies the work of Droog, an informal confederation of Dutch designers founded by Gijs Bakker, a product designer, and Renny Ramakers, an art historian. It consists of recycled drawer fronts inserted in newly constructed wooden boxes held together by a commercial cinch strap. Witty yet functional, it may seem to be merely a mélange of used and new furniture parts, but in fact it is a well-considered composition, balanced in both shape and color. The customer is invited to rearrange the parts at will. Droog’s dramatic and sometimes heretical approach challenges accepted ideas of decorum in design and materials.
 Adolescence has become ubiquitous subject matter in contemporary photography. Whether it is the awkwardness of Rineke Dijkstra’s gangly prepubescents or the sexuality, malaise, and dysfunction depicted by Larry Clark, the worlds of adolescents and teenagers seem to have been exhaustively described. While Lise Sarfati continues to mine this rich vein of subject matter, she evokes a slightly different tone. In her first book of photographs, Acta Est, she documented the dark, emotional territory of wayward youth in post-Soviet Russia. Robin, #43, Oakland, CA is from her subsequent project, titled The American Series. Published in book form as The New Life, the series comprises images of young people from Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, and California. Directionless, dispossessed, and dejected, these young people (mainly young women) appear ghost-like and unattached to their surroundings. Sarfati’s subjects transcend their social, political, or cultural categories; as carriers of individual, as well as universal, psychological states, they represent the interstitial space between inertia and movement. In Robin, #43, Oakland, CA, the young woman gazes into a backyard hidden from view. Framed by the intersecting lines of backyard fences bathed in a saturated cyan light, Robin may sit firmly on her home soil, but she is emotionally unmoored from it.
 Louise Bourgeois is celebrated for sculptures and drawings that powerfully abstract and critically engage the female form. Eyes sheds light on the importance of eyes as visual symbols. The third eye, as seen on Kali, has often been associated with supernatural powers in Indian mythology and continues to appear in contemporary imagery. The act of gazing into numerous eyes might also recall the practice of darshan, a dialectical and spiritual way of looking that considers the object as both image and living being, providing an experience of seeing that informs South Asian culture.—CG
 
There is something magical about a reflection in a mirror. It seems to be an accurate record of what it represents, but it is reversed left to right and is subject to manipulation and distortion. Michelangelo Pistoletto plays with the idea of reflection and the merging of art and everyday life in this work.Figures are silkscreened on a piece of reflective stainless steel, creating permanent content for the piece. But as viewers pass in front of it, temporary inhabitants of the space—you—also appear and disappear.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces, such as the "Casablanca" cabinet displayed here, were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 The use of sand to suggest the movement of water is common in traditional Japanese raked sand, or kare sansui, gardens. The most famous example is the sixteenth-century garden of the Zen temple Ryonanji in Kyoto, which in expressing the expanse of the oceans is intended to represent the entire universe. In order to achieve the same effect in his ceramic vessel, Sakiyama constructed the form from three slabs of clay that were carved into the wave pattern. After firing the vase once, he then covered it with a sand-infused glaze and refired it to stoneware temperature.
 Employing the traditional print medium of etching (most often associated with European masters such as Rembrandt), the contemporary African American artist Kara Walker loads images of the Civil War era with grotesque stereotypes and elements of violence and sexuality. By doing so, Walker challenges heroic Civil War narratives and forces the viewer to confront the dishonesty of sanitized accounts of historical race relations.

 The Thunderbolt was one of three classic wooden roller coasters constructed at Coney Island in the 1920s. Built on the Bowery in 1925 above the late nineteenth-century Kensington Hotel, the Thunderbolt was featured in Woody Allen’s film Annie Hall, in which the character Alvy Singer lived in the former hotel under the roller coaster. The Thunderbolt was closed in 1983 and demolished in 2000 together with the house, which was occupied until the end. The site remains empty today, next to the new KeySpan Park. The Tornado, the second of the signature roller coasters, also on the Bowery, burned in 1977, while the third, the Cyclone, has been a New York City Historic Landmark since 1991. KeySpan Park, home of the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team, opened on the site of Steeplechase Park in 2001 and was part of longtime efforts to rejuvenate Coney Island.
 James Turrell’s art centers on the perception of light in architectural spaces. He employed aerial landscape views in works related to his most ambitious site project, an “observatory” within the Roden Crater in Arizona. Turrell chose the site during aerial flyovers in the late 1970s, and since then he has been constructing viewing spaces that admit the natural light of the sun and stars in various ways to create specific perceptual effects. A meeting of science and art, Turrell’s work draws on the power of place, geologic time, and humanity’s long relationship to celestial phenomena.
 New technology often inspires artists to rethink traditional forms and create objects of great originality. In this instance, the designer has worked largely on a computer to realize his design. He began with a birch plywood cube, a modern building material, and two traditional images, of a Baroque table and a bombé chest (a low cabinet with serpentine curves), which he conflated and morphed on his computer. He then divided his design into fifty-seven virtual slices, or cross-sections, and utilizing a computer numerical controlled (CNC) laser, cut the cube from two directions simultaneously to create a silhouette with complex compound curves. The table is composed of 741 layers of birch plywood. It was limited to an edition of twenty that is now sold out.
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”

 By Western standards, modern jewelry making is not widely known in Israel. The few Israeli artists who do create modernist jewelry have often studied abroad and exhibit and sell their designs in Europe. Schocken, who lives in Jerusalem, was trained as an architect in Israel and then went to England to learn jewelry making. Her jewelry is reductivist and abstract and reflects her lifelong passion for modern architecture, in particular Tel Aviv's well-known cache of Bauhaus-inspired buildings from the 1920s and 1930s.

 Lynn Hyman Butler’s Coney Island Kaleidoscope series combats the idea of Coney Island as a time capsule of nostalgia. During a period of crime and political and financial instability, artists such as Butler considered the site’s uncertain fate as a subject for their work. Saturated colors glide through these playful images, taken while Butler was physically in motion, emulating the vision of a visitor in flux on an amusement park ride. The figures in these two photographs stride forward boldly in contemporary attire: sundresses and straw hats, and leather vests with tattooed arms. The vibrant energy and sense of movement and chaos reject sentimentality, alluding to the velocity of time. Butler is interested in conveying the rush of disorder and the change from past to present Coney Island, and aims to signal the need for historic preservation in its future.

 Using square steel plates coated with white baked enamel as the basic module, Jennifer Bartlett explores the fine line between representational and abstract painting. Characteristic of her work during this time, Bartlett used this module technique, basic geometric figures, and primary colors—in this case the triangle and the color red—to reveal the fragile line that separates an abstract symbol from an ordinary object, such as a house or a mountain.
 This young boy, a child laborer, alludes to both the global history of sugar and the contentious history of representation of African and African-descended people. Operating in what Kara Walker calls “the fissure between desire for and revulsion against,” he demonstrates both racist objectification and strange affection. Made of resin and coated in sugar, he highlights the impact of the triangular trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas, and the enslaved people who were the foundation of the sugar industry and of European and American economies from the sixteenth century on. This figure is a permanent version of an attendant from Walker’s installation A Subtlety, a public project at the Domino Sugar Refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2014.
 In some regions of Ghana, it is typical for the shape and style of a coffin to make a personal statement by reflecting the profession, interests, or characteristics of the deceased. The mother of many children might have a coffin in the shape of a hen with chicks. In this case, it is a Nike sneaker, a symbol of status and modernity in the late twentieth century. As people make the transition from one world to the unknown next, an object (a coffin) representing another object (in this case, a shoe) provides comforting familiarity.
 This relief was once brightly painted, as was most temple decoration. Unlike most temple reliefs, however, it was partially inlaid. The corpulent figures, labeled as bodies of water, were part of a procession of geographical personifications conveying the idea of parts of Egypt showing their submission and bringing their bounty  to the temple.
 This work is inspired by Gary Simmons’s ongoing exploration of sports, history, race, and class in American popular culture. It is based on the tragic events surrounding a nationally televised boxing match at Madison Square Garden on March 24, 1962. Emile Griffith and Benny Paret, immigrants from Saint Thomas and Cuba, respectively, battled for the welterweight title. Paret was gravely hurt and died from his injuries ten days later. Vintage fight posters, with the two fighters’ names clearly visible, make up the background of Convention Hall. Two ghostly falling stars, portraits of sorts, perhaps allude to the hardships both men experienced, in and out of the ring.
 Coming to Detroit at an early age, Harry Bertoia first learned jewelry making and later studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he remained after graduation to head the metalworking department. Bertoia created large-scale public-sculpture commissions as well as small-scale decorative pieces such as Bush, which demonstrates his early training in jewelry and fine metalworking. Although abstract, Bush evokes an underwater creature or a dandelion plant that has lost its fuzzy spores.
 Dotty Attie often appropriates historical works of art by male artists to demonstrate gender inequalities within the art world. Barred from the Studio is part of her late 1980s series Episodes from the Lives of the Masters. Here Attie adapts two famous works by the American painter Thomas Eakins, Max Schmitt in a Single Scull, 1871, and The Gross Clinic, 1875. Her text documents the uproar caused when Eakins, a professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, allowed female students to attend life classes with nude male models. She points out the hypocrisy of Victorian society, which took offense at not only the frank representation of a surgeon’s bloodied hands, but also the idea of women observing and understanding male anatomy.
 Hellen van Meene’s photograph is an illuminating example of this young Dutch photographer’s practice of portraiture. The young woman looks away from the viewer, her body contorted, as if frozen in a movement to shield herself from invading gazes. Light streams through a window from outside the picture, falling softly on her pale skin. It highlights not only her dyed blond hair but also her shoulder blade, oddly jutting out, unsettling the contour and emphasizing her thin frame. The partial shadow reveals the texture of the skin, including goose pimples and the deep impression of a bra. Like her fellow Dutch portraitist Rineke Dijkstra, van Meene focuses on transitional states, usually, in van Meene's case, the pubescent girl, her vulnerability and doubts, poised somewhere between childhood and womanhood. As with many of van Meene's subjects, this adolescent has been posed by the artist to play a role. Interested in the dramatic potential of portraiture, in the tradition of artists such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Claude Cahun, van Meene does not intend to objectively document her subjects nor to catch their personalities, but rather, with the help of her models, to create a certain mood. Selecting subjects among young people she knows in her neighborhood as well as teenagers she meets on the street when traveling, van Meene carefully stages her pictures. Usually set in a shallow space, close to the picture plane, the models are prepared down to the smallest detail: make-up; wardrobe, if any; the pose; the direction of the gaze. And in this case, the little flower that just makes it into the picture in the lower right corner.
 Alison Elizabeth Taylor’s Security House examines the contemporary landscape and culture of the southwestern United States. She uses marquetry, a woodworking technique dating from the Renaissance, to depict a dilapidated tract house amid an unkempt yard. Selecting wood veneers in a variety of grains and earthy desert tones, she embellishes the scene with details that suggest narratives relating to housing foreclosures and fears about border security. Security House taps into a long-standing romance with the American frontier, while also suggesting the persistence of boom-and-bust cycles that have historically characterized towns in the West.
 
 Photographed in a studio against a neutral background, Andres Serrano’s portrait shows a Navajo woman in traditional dress. While the photograph’s large scale monumentalizes the subject, Serrano depicts his sitter in a direct and dignified manner, producing a sense of engaging intimacy. Serrano has explored fundamental issues related to sex, religion, race, and prejudice throughout his career. Whatever his subject matter, he always considers himself a portraitist. He has often expressed his admiration of both August Sander, the 1920s chronicler of people in various segments of German society, and Edward S. Curtis, who in the early twentieth century aimed at documenting the disappearance of traditional life among the indigenous peoples of North America. Curtis has been criticized for fabricating a false reality, staging scenes and retouching his photographs to conform to a stereotypical idea of traditional Native culture. To Serrano, however, it is the sense of dignity in Curtis’s depictions that matters, and this quality comes through in his own portrait of Lyndell Yazzie.

Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Leon Polk Smith was born in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) a century ago. After receiving a Masters in Art Education at Columbia University in 1938, he had his first one-person exhibition in 1941. Since then his work has been featured in countless exhibitions worldwide.An admirer of the abstract paintings of Piet Mondrian, Smith decided early in his career to dispense with the recognizable object as part of his paintings. In the mid-1940s he began painting abstract compositions based on the relationships of basic geometric elements, which he gradually reduced to a minimum.Jubilee, one of Smith's late works, is an extreme example of this economy of means. The four lines seem to move across the canvas, suggesting spatial relationships and depth of field. The painting illustrates well a statement of the artist's creative principles that he wrote in 1961: "Three elements which interested me in art are line, color, and the concept of space and its use as a positive force."
 This flamboyant necklace is typical of the decorative projects of Rhonda Zwillinger, who is also a well-known avant-garde photographer and was a leading artist in the emergence of New York's East Village as a vital center of contemporary art in the 1980s. Using inexpensive plastic sequins and beads, Zwillinger embellishes her jewelry, everyday objects such as found handbags, and entire room installations to astonishing effect. This necklace, which the artist describes as "wearable ecstasy" sold for $125 at the Gracie Mansion Gallery in the East Village in 1987.
 ART OF BELIEFEach of these works is the product of a religious tradition that synthesized and adapted new beliefs and art forms to existing faith systems. Both objects are testaments to the long-standing global nature of African religions, ideas, and art. The stone sculpture represents Serapis, a composite god created early in the Ptolemaic (Greek) rule of Egypt to unite Greeks and Egyptians. The deity combined aspects of Egyptian gods (especially Osiris, the ruler of the Underworld) with Greek deities (particularly Zeus, the king of the gods). Worship of Serapis continued in the Roman period and eventually spread to Europe. The painting depicts al-Buraq, the winged horse with a woman's head on which the prophet Muhammad flew the mi'raj, his nocturnal journey to heaven to meet God. Like many in Senegal, Gora Mbengue was a member of a Sufi order, a group dedicated to the practice of a mystical interpretation of Islam. Sufism played an important role in the spread of Islam in West Africa, inspiring schools and movements particularly open to melding new and existing systems of belief and image making. Reverse glass painting (souwère) developed by 1900 in Senegal's cities, as pilgrims on the hajj to Mecca brought the technique back from the eastern Mediterranean.
 As she has done in the past, Nina Abney here creates a highly personal, imaginative, and eclectic interpretation of a literary source. Forbidden Fruit, part of a series inspired by Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, alludes to the chapter featuring a hookah-puffing caterpillar. According to the artist, the composition of the figures and the choice of light blue and green were drawn from Henri Matisse’s 1909 painting The Dance. Sea-Monkeys (a species of brine shrimp sold as curiosities during the artist’s childhood) provided the model for the two figures with antennae sitting on the left, and the numbers that appear on various figures also have personal meaning for Abney. Though the original Alice is absent here, Abney’s boldly hued hallucinatory scene populated by fantastic creatures vividly simulates the magical environment of the text, in which Alice experiments with mushrooms that allow her to grow and shrink in size.
 ART OF WRITINGBoth of these works, separated by many centuries, use the human body as a platform for expressing and displaying script. Shabtis are funerary figures intended to do the agricultural work the gods might require of the deceased, represented here holding hoes. The hieroglyphic inscription on this figure is a spell from the Book of the Dead, asking the shabti to do the Nubian king Senkamanisken’s work for him in the afterlife. Owusu-Ankomah's paintings depict a spiritual world occupied by people and symbols. The male figure in this work is covered by, and moves within, Akan adinkra symbols from the artist's native Ghana, each of which graphically represents a particular concept or proverb. Looking Back Into the Future depicts a nude man with his head turned backward, in a pose associated with the Akan proverbial concept of sankofa ("one must know the past to know the future"). You can see a contemporary version of adinkra cloth among the "touch" textiles around the corner.
 ART OF PORTRAITSWhile Western artists have historically often attempted to represent a person exactly how they look, many African artists instead have created portraits based on a specific physical or personality feature of the subject. This terracotta head, most likely depicting the oni, or king, of ancient Ife, shows that Yoruba sculpture was already highly developed a thousand years ago. Ife court art interprets the human figure with extraordinary naturalism. This head, however, is not intended to be truly representational or realistic. It shows the oni in the prime of life, with no imperfections. Fiegnon is composed chiefly of a discarded oil jerry can. Although Fiegnon may appear to resemble a mask, Romuald Hazoumé has noted that his works are, in fact, portraits—of particular individuals or of social types. With its long braids, this work represents a Fulani man Hazoumé met fishing in the lagoon where he found the oilcan. The striking differences in style and materials in these two portraits may also reflect a marked gap in status and power between their two subjects.
Kaneta Masanao forms his pieces using the kurinuki technique, which involves scooping, pinching, and scraping a block of clay into the desired shape. Like many other Japanese studio potters, Masanao sees a close link between sculpture and ceramic art.
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 ART OF DESIGNAfrican artists have a long history of responding to fresh design concepts, while always revising them to ends both practical and novel. Together, these three works trace the evolution of a single form: first, as an imported idea became African, and then as contemporary artists adapted this African form for a global market. Most seats in sub-Saharan Africa are low stools, carved from a single block of wood. Yet, as early as the sixteenth century, Portuguese traders and explorers introduced chairs with backs to southern and eastern Africa. Chokwe artists soon began to produce similar chairs, adding sculptural scenes and Chokwe motifs. This wood chair was carved as an object of status for a chief. In fact, none of these three chairs were meant for sitting. Gonçalo Mabunda's Harmony chair uses decommissioned handguns, bullet belts, and other munitions collected from the estimated 7 million weapons left in Mozambique following the end of its civil war in 1992. Its design references a coastal East African tradition of high-backed chairs that were symbols of power and prestige, discussion and debate. The Sansa chair, an inventive deconstruction of the chair form, is among the original creations that have established Cheick Diallo as one of Africa's leading contemporary designers. Built at Diallo's direction by artisans from Bamako, the half-reclining Sansa chair seems to sit midway between a European notion of the chair as a leisure object and a West African idea of the chair as a support for displaying a person of status.

 Music played an important role in Romare Bearden's art. He especially loved jazz, and his method as a visual artist was based in part on what he had learned from jazz musicians about improvisation. As in jazz, the unpredictable repetitions and juxtapositions of shapes, textures, and colors in his art create startling, unexpected visual rhythms. As Bearden once said about being an artist: "You must become a blues singer—only you sing on the canvas. You improvise—you find the rhythm and catch it good, and structure as you go along—then the song is you. Music has always been important for me the way it has been important for many Blacks. Blacks have made their own sound, their own musical language like jazz. It is theirs and they identify with it. In a world of constantly changing identities, certain forms of music represent a solid identity for Blacks."
 Shooting primarily in the United States and the Caribbean, Deana Lawson is inspired by the expression and aesthetics of black cultures worldwide. Using a large-format camera, and working across a variety of photographic traditions—including portraiture, staged scenes, found or appropriated imagery, and vernacular photography such as family albums—she addresses themes of the body, sensuality, community, and spirituality, among others. Lawson’s photographs can be seen as psychological portraits of black subjects in an extended, mythological diasporic family.
 Since the early 1990s, Nick Cave has been fabricating inventive sculptures out of scavenged materials, which he often overlays with beadwork, stitching, and other embellishments. One of the first, crafted from twigs, was made to be worn and created a rustling sound, which led to the eventual name of such works: Soundsuits. Cave’s costumes draw from a variety of sources, including both African and Caribbean traditions of masquerade.In performance, Cave’s work invokes moments of whimsical transcendence—but a very real, grounded, and nuanced understanding of the racialized nature of American society is often just underneath. Overcoming the distinctions between “fine art” and “craft,” as well as “performance” and “street” art, Cave’s Soundsuits may also serve as a sort of armor, protecting against the violence of racial stereotypes and giving their wearers an outsize, fanciful, and transcendent presence. Cave designed his first Soundsuit in response to the brutal police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1992.Cave’s costumes enable performers to be seen free from the constraints of being placed in categories, and to be free to transform their environment into an otherworldly space.
 In the ongoing series Sunday Paintings, Byron Kim inscribes personal notes about his daily life onto his painted images of the sky. In nuanced hues of blue, each of the six examples shown here represents the sky on the Sunday it was painted. The words sit on the picture plane, creating a play between the painting as a flat surface and as a window opening onto the illusion of deep space. Lined up on a wall, the Sunday Paintings have a cinematic quality: each panel looks like a frame in a film sequence—a moment in time stilled—as if each is a part of a larger ongoing whole. While the works were created on Sundays, the title of this series also refers to amateurs known as “Sunday painters,” admired by Kim for the purity of their motives in making art.

 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA.

Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 Sol LeWitt, active from the 1960s, was a pioneer of Minimalism and Conceptual art. He often worked with simple geometric forms—particularly the cube—straight lines, and ninety-degree angles. Hanging Structure’s suspended three-dimensional grid, composed of identical, monochromatic units, is emblematic of this interest. In contrast, Terence Koh, inspired by queer, punk, and DIY cultures, belongs to a 1990s generation whose work is more personally inflected. Embracing decay and ephemerality, Untitled (Vitrines) displays whitewashed objects collected from friends, lovers, Koh’s childhood, and flea markets, acting almost as a shrine preserving relics from his life. The sculpture departs significantly from LeWitt’s strict vision yet engages with the legacies of Minimalism and Conceptual art, exploring the possibilities of the grid and the monochrome and extending those formal considerations into the personal realm.
 ART OF IDEASAfrican art is conceptual art. In both form and use, it reveals sophisticated systems of knowledge, but rarely directly. These two seemingly unrelated works express hidden and poignant ideas about security and liberty. An nkisi nkondi embodies defensive power and was used to protect a community. To complete this sculpture, a ritual expert placed potent ingredients associated with supernatural powers in the cavity carved into the figure’s abdomen. Nails and blades activated the spirit that was now accessible through the figure. This nkisi's pose, with hands on hips, symbolizes its readiness to defend the righteous and to destroy enemies. In Viyé Diba's work, the piece of painted yellow wood, projecting between the seams of the woven canvas, and the abstract forms that suggest fleeing figures at the top evoke the possibility of liberation—from the literal plane of the canvas, from the strictures of painting and sculpture, or, perhaps, from the history of the city of Dakar itself, the site of a former way station in the trade of human captives. Diba's art is composed entirely of materials he found walking around Dakar.
 This fragment from one of the stained-glass windows that Henry E. Sharp designed for the Church of St. Ann's in Brooklyn Heights in 1867–69 illustrates the artist's decorating technique. Some of the elements in his windows were solid pieces of colored glass; others were pieces of colorless glass overlaid, or flashed, with a thin layer of colored glass–in this case, dark blue. The colored glass was coated with a vitreous black paint, a stencil was placed over the paint, and a craftsman scratched away the black to reveal the design. The glass pieces were then fired in a kiln to fix the black color. Over time, the black paint slowly faded, as can be seen in the pale yellow ground of the complete window by Sharp displayed here. The more intense black seen in the window's three central medallions and blue, red, and green borders is the result of recent conservation. Colorless glass was placed on the back of the faded pieces, and the original design was repainted in black on the new glass.
 Walton Ford draws his inspiration from the work of such artists as the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century fantasy painter Hieronymus Bosch, the nineteenth-century naturalist John James Audubon, and the nineteenth-century French caricaturist J. J. Grandville, whose parthuman, part-animal subjects satirize man’s shortcomings. Although very different from Ford’s more recent watercolors, these four early oil paintings, a series of family portraits where the image is complicated and turned grotesque by the juxtaposition of repulsive elements close to the sitter’s face, hint at the artist’s continuing interest in the association of man and animal. Ford often explores this interest in relation to the history of colonialism, nineteenth-century industrialism, or contemporary politics.

 Green Hands and Faces is from a powerful group of paintings by Ross Bleckner that take on a subject of importance to the artist since the 1980s—the loss of friends and loved ones to AIDS. Each luminous spot on the canvas's surface stands metaphorically as a glowing flame, a flickering symbol of a deceased person whose life remains as a memory. As if created by a source emanating from the depth of darkness, the "hands" and "faces" are the result of fine modulation of reflective oil paint and varnish.
 Incorporating a well-worn wooden table and a misshapen ceramic bowl, Jessica Jackson Hutchins’s Kitchen Table Allegory uses design objects to create a sculpture that evokes the private world of the home. The table served Hutchins and her family until she decided to use it as the plate for a series of prints that were initially presented with the sculpture. Personal without devolving into the confessional, the work situates the source of creative inspiration within the familial and the everyday.
 A Composition for Detroit is a portrait of contemporary America. Inspired by many trips to Detroit and its banks of broken factory windows, some overpainted, Sara VanDerBeek built structures that functioned as supports for leaning panes of glass and a wide range of photographic imagery. She then photographed her ephemeral installations before dismantling them. The photographic material includes close-ups of images such as, in the first panel, a Walker Evans photograph of the ruins of a pre–Civil War plantation in Louisiana and a Charles Moore picture of a crouching woman, sprayed with water, during a 1963 civil rights protest. VanDerBeek also used documentary material, some dealing with riots in Detroit in 1967, as well as her own evocative photographs of abandoned buildings and broken blinds. The photographs contribute to the subtle telling of stories that move from left to right across the four panels, or from back to front within each panel. According to the artist, the allusions to windows, stairs, and doorways in all the panels open up the possibility of either staying where we are or taking off in new directions.
 “It was my first self-assigned art project at twenty years of age,” Stephen Salmieri says of his Coney Island series, “My instincts knew better than I did.” The artist’s feelings of spontaneity and independence are echoed in this photograph of four boys with fishing rods in hand perched atop jagged boulders and surrounded by waves. Here, Salmieri underscores the sense of exploration and adventure that Coney Island provides to young people who crave a break from the city.

 This work by the Salish, French-Cree, and Shoshone artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith explores the challenges of Native American coexistence with American culture. The Plains woman’s dress featured prominently in the painting is worn by those in the Ghost Dance Religion to recall the vision of John Wilson (better known as Wovoka), who prophesied that white people would vanish and Native Americans would return to take back the land that was once theirs. The religious movement offered hope to many homeless, ill, and hungry Native Americans, and its message and surrounding tensions are, according to the artist, conveyed through various elements in this work: the eagle appears as a messenger of the prophecy; bingo cards are meant to represent the Catholic Church’s introduction of gambling to reservations; and written texts convey the “Queen of Hearts” children’s rhyme, a reference to power.
 Conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth reproduces a quotation from Austrian-born Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations, published in 1953. That volume, composed of 693 numbered paragraphs, examines the topic of language and its ability to create meaning. Wittgenstein’s text questions our perception of blueness; Kosuth responds in a sense by representing that text in glowing blue neon, as part of his own ongoing investigation into the elusive relationship between words, things, and their visual representation.
 Kiki Smith’s Annunciation continues the artist’s long exploration of monumental sculptures of women that examine both the physical and psychological aspects of the body within a feminist context. The figure, with its suit and bald head, is gender-neutral. Its oversize head, delicate features, and dangling feet convey a sense of vulnerability, while its upraised eyes and outstretched arm suggest engagement in a rich inner life. Drawing upon her Catholic upbringing, Smith uses the Annunciation—the angel Gabriel’s revelation to the Virgin Mary that she will conceive Jesus—as a metaphor for the moment of creative inspiration.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Kara Walker subverts the original function of nineteenth-century cut-paper silhouettes, initially used for portraits of socially prominent individuals. She reinterprets the medium to create intense explorations of relationships based on power. Here, working in cut steel, Walker includes stereotypical Civil War imagery of the South—a stately plantation mansion, small huts, enslaved African Americans, Confederate soldiers, and Southern belles. As she explores stereotypes, Walker offers no resolution, and her presentation includes neither villains nor heroes. This “play set” even seems to suggest that the cast of characters and their settings could be reorganized, creating new narratives that revolve around issues of oppression and power, race and gender, and moral ambiguity.
 The Half Moon Hotel opened on the boardwalk in 1927. Its name referred to the explorer Henry Hudson’s ship, which anchored off Gravesend Bay on Coney Island in 1609 before continuing toward what would be called Manhattan and the Hudson River. Initially fashionable and well attended, the hotel suffered from the general decline and became a maternity hospital in the late 1940s. A senior citizens’ home was built on the site in the 1970s. This ghostlike image by John L. Murphy captures the memory of time past at Coney Island. Filled with both sadness and nostalgia, it conflates many layers of the site’s history.
 Becoming AgainMasquerade is a moment for play—a chance to invent and experiment, even within established social needs and existing mask genres. These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.The two Bobo works share a basic form—a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns—typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.The Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.
 In his short life, the artist Michael Richards often created work related to the struggles and triumphs of African Americans. He spent nearly ten years, for example, on a series of sculptures dedicated to the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black aviators—named for their base in Tuskegee, Alabama—who during World War II became the first African American military pilots in the history of the United States. For this particular sculpture, as with others in the series, Richards made a fiberglass mold of his own body and then pierced the work with nails (other sculptures in the series are impaled by toy airplanes). The sculpture thus refers both to Christian iconography (St. Sebastian, depicted with a body full of arrows) and to African objects known as nkisi nkondi.In a tragic and eerie twist of fate, Michael Richards was working as an artist-In-residence with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council at its studios in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001, and died in the attack on Tower 1. He did not live to witness the surviving Tuskegee Airmen receive the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal, on March 29, 2007.
 Yuji Agematsu has been transforming the raw material of life into art for nearly thirty years. In the Zip series, an array of objects—collected during the artist’s daily walks through New York City—are displayed on shelves, with each unit of shelves representing a month’s collecting. The pieces are both a record of his wanderings and a repository for the residue of our collective consumption. Collector, curator, and archivist, he states: “I walk around the city during the night too. The empty streets have a feeling akin to a beach when the tide is low. The objects are left where both big and small waves of the consumerist society have ebbed; people call them rubbish, waste, trash, and so on, which nevertheless talk to me, even eloquently at times.”

 At the forefront of the African-American avant-garde in Los Angeles and New York in the 1960s and 1970s, Senga Nengudi was first recognized for her anthropomorphic nylon mesh sculptures, such as Inside/Outside. The bulbous stockings twist and strain under the weight of the sand they contain, calling to mind both the rhythm of a swinging pendulum and exposed internal organs. The work also conjures the image of a traditional African headdress, telling of Nengudi’s interest in African philosophy and ritual. The artist’s background as a dancer and choreographer informs her practice, and she has often utilized works such as Inside/Outside in her own performances, testing the limit of her constructions by wearing and stretching the nylons to the brink of bursting.
 In 2005, Mary Coble staged a twelve-hour endurance performance titled Note to Self, in which she had the first names of 438 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender victims of hate-crime murders tattooed over her entire body without ink. Vivid evidence of Coble’s harrowing artistic process appears in this photograph. As the fresh needle punctures imprinted names on her lower leg, the artist’s blood mingled with an older ink tattoo, a rainbow-hued chain of figures emblematic of a diverse community. This documentary photograph shows Coble’s body as a locus for reflection on both the physical nature of assaults inflicted on hate-crime victims and the reporting of their deaths. The artist’s preparatory research revealed that anti-gay words were carved into some of the victims’ skin. She also discovered that no centralized database exists for hatecrime statistics, since individual states are not required to report hate-crime deaths to the FBI or any other federal agency.
 Fred Wilson often appropriates art objects to explore issues of race, gender, class, politics, and aesthetics. Made up of five portrait heads of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, Grey Area (Brown Version) refers to one of the most copied works of ancient civilization. The otherwise identical plaster effigies, which he purchased and painted, illustrate a value scale ranging in color from oatmeal to dark chocolate. Thus, Wilson raises, but does not answer, controversial questions about the racial identity of ancient Egyptians. In both his provocative, groundbreaking installations in cultural institutions and in his studio work, Wilson encourages viewers to recognize how changes in context create changes in meaning. He has said of his practice, “I use beauty as a way of helping people to receive difficult or upsetting ideas. The topical issues are merely a vehicle for making one aware of one’s own perceptual shift—which is the real thrill.”
 Mickalene Thomas creates monumental pictures that explore and challenge the representation and objectification of women, and black women in particular. She draws inspiration from images of iconic African American women, emblems of the Black Power Movement, and her mother’s photographs from the 1970s. Here, she casts an African American woman as leading lady in an updated version of an established visual archetype—a sexualized female subject seemingly caught unaware as she reclines passively in her own beauty. In doing so, the artist turns the historic nude on its head and ousts the white European woman from the bed where she often lounges, attended by a black maidservant, in Western art.
 Hew Locke constructed Koh-i-noor, one of three monumental portraits of Queen Elizabeth, out of hundreds of kitschy plastic toys and trinkets, disposable products of the new global economy. The bristling blades of toy sabers suggest might and power. With this work, Locke, who was born in Britain and raised in Guyana, explores tensions between contemporary British society and its colonial past. The title refers to the Koh-i-noor diamond, a legendary treasure dating back to fourteenth-century India. Once the largest diamond in the world, it passed through the hands of Sikh, Mughal, and Persian rulers as a highly prized spoil of war. In 1877 the British government declared Queen Victoria the Empress of India, and the diamond entered the British Crown Jewels collection.
 BM (3Fb) is part of Luis Mallo’s Open Secrets, a recent group of photographs taken in museums in New York City and elsewhere. The series focuses on storage areas and reveals hidden spaces not typically accessible to the public. This image, from the Brooklyn Museum, shows storage for sculptures whose identity in most cases is partially obscured by protective wrapping. The photographer’s careful composition represents only a fragment of a larger whole, revealing the beauty within the more or less organized structure of museum storage while not decoding the system itself. Mallo does not stage or rearrange any items, and his mostly straightforward composition aspires to an objective viewpoint. The combination of sometimes random objects, however, creates a sense of mystery and reminds us that collections are not always easy to classify.

 Norman Mizuno began making jewelry as a child in his native Hawaii, helping his mother fashion pieces from tropical seeds and nuts for the tourist trade. According to the artist, the beads that constitute this necklace, which he terms "clay body jewelry," were made between 1972 and 1980 and then reconfigured in 1990. Mizuno cites a wide variety of influences, from ancient Egyptian and Mayan artifacts to Las Vegas showgirl costumes.
 Matsubayashi Yukoan, who is based in Uji, Kyoto, works in the subtle gohonde style of Asahi ware, a centuries-old specialty of the Matsubayashi family. This work, which was designed expressly for the Museum collection, has the superb coloration referred to as higawari ("changing in the fire"), a result of the interaction between kiln structure, pine fuel, and a special clay called kase.
 The motif of "three friends" popular in East Asian literary culture is here presented as a repeated stylized shōchikubai (pine, plum, and bamboo) pattern carved in a diagonal rectangular grid.
 Modern Artists and Ancient EgyptLorraine O’Grady uses ancient Egyptian art to explore contemporary issues. Artists from many times and places have been inspired by the heritage of ancient Egypt to make new works that speak to their own time. Displaying works like this within the Egyptian Galleries allows visitors to participate in the ongoing dialogue that artists have pursued with the ancients, as they have expressed their stake in ancient history and its continuing relevance. Lorraine O’Grady’s photographs grew out of a 1980 performance called Nefertiti/Devonia Evangeline, which took place in front of a series of projected images similar to the ones seen here. The work examined the troubled relationship between O’Grady and her deceased sister, Devonia Evangeline, through juxtaposed portraits of the Egyptian queens Nefertiti and Mutnedjmet, of a later reign, proposed by some scholars to be Nefertiti’s sister. Though the subject matter is deeply personal, it allows O’Grady to address issues of class, racism, ethnography, and African American art. Thus, as the artist says, her work attempts to “make the historic personal and the personal historic.”
 Wendell Castle, one of America’s most important contemporary furniture makers, has had several distinct stylistic phases in his career. At first he employed both exotic and native American woods to produce furniture characterized by biomorphic forms and attenuated surrealism. By the 1960s, he had begun experimenting with plastic and fiberglass to create seamless organic designs. In the 1980s, he became fascinated with Post-Modernism and produced highly architectural, polychromatic designs. In 2007 he received the Brooklyn Museum/Modernism Lifetime Achievement Award. The Nirvana chair was a gift of the artist in acknowledgment of the Museum’s ongoing commitment to his work.
 Kehinde Wiley presents large-scale portraits of young black men as saints and angels, in poses inspired by paintings from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In creating these monumental paintings, Wiley borrows poses, imagery, and titles from works by master painters such as Tiepolo (1727–1804). Dressed in their everyday clothes, the figures float over flat, brightly colored backgrounds suggestive of infinite space. By placing these "new" subjects within the context of art history, Wiley challenges the prevailing representations of black men in contemporary American society.
 Jules de Balincourt’s monumental painting Not Yet Titled continues a tradition of portraying dramatic landscapes that characterized the Hudson River School of painters. Unlike his predecessors, whose elaborate studio canvases drew on specific details of actual sites, here de Balincourt favors a generic touristic landscape with a steep waterfall that empties into a body of water ringed by palm trees. Tiny figures in boats enhance the atmosphere of leisure-time pleasure, which is set against the forces of nature. Utilizing a flat, painterly, almost intentionally naïve technique of painting, de Balincourt can be regarded as part of a general revival of painting that began to occur in the early twenty-first century. The acquisition of Not Yet Titled will initiate an intriguing dialogue between contemporary practice and the distinguished nineteenth-century American landscape paintings in the collection. Born in France and educated in the United States, de Balincourt is based in Brooklyn.
 George Bradford Brainerd’s photograph of Fourth Avenue, close to the southern edge of Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood, shows the low-cost dwellings lining the street in the late nineteenth century. Crowded tenement buildings replaced the shanties about 1900, and until recently the wide and heavily trafficked avenue retained much of its neglected character. Over the last few years, however, gentrification reached this lower section of Park Slope, and the old tenement buildings are now being razed or upgraded to make space for more expensive housing.Further south, Red Hook is undergoing a similar transformation. With easy access to the open sea, Red Hook became a busy industrial area in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, dominated by the activities of the port and inexpensive housing for workers of local businesses. By the time of Lynn Saville’s photograph in the late 1990s, however, many of the industrial structures had long been abandoned and artists and artisans were occupying the former warehouses. The demolition earlier this year of the sugar refinery in the background of Saville’s picture signals the definite turn of the neighborhood in a new direction. An explosion of residential and retail construction and a recently inaugurated cruise-ship terminal are examples of the contentious redevelopment of the area.
Native American artists Marcellus and Elizabeth Toya Medina and Kevin Pourier create works inspired by both old and new art forms. The painted designs on the water jar of classic Pueblo shape combine traditional masked Kachinas in static poses with naturalistic, muscled, male Pueblo dancers who seem to burst off the vessel’s surface. The inlaid buffalo-horn spoon, a traditional Plains implement, is given a contemporary twist in Pourier’s homage to M. C. Escher’s hypnotic prints.
 In Shack, Elizabeth Murray takes apart the structure of a house, simultaneously showing its interior and exterior, the cobblestone path leading to it, and a window through which the sun is visible. Although her art usually grows out of everyday experiences, she made this print after one of her paintings, working from a Polaroid image. Irregularly shaped, with overlapping planes and elements that project from the surface, Shack explores the creative possibilities in transferring a work from canvas, and pushes the boundaries of printmaking, while maintaining the artist’s signature cartoon-like style.
 For Lydia Buzio the forms of traditional vessels are the starting point for an untraditional treatment that employs contemporary aesthetics and techniques. After the basic shape is selected, the artist draws urban scenes, frequently based on New York cityscapes, on the unfired clay. Each vessel is a work in progress as the artist reevaluates the results and develops the piece by adding color and detail with pigmented slips. She burnishes the surface carefully before firing and then waxes it lightly.
 George Segal was an innovator in sculpture known for his installations of white plaster figures with ghostly appearances. He depicted the dignity in everyday life, showing people poised at a bus stop, paused before a traffic intersection, or conversing on a park bench. Segal's work also took on political themes such as the Holocaust and gay pride. At the time this sculpture was created, the artist discussed its art historical references: "The chair is like a ladder with steps, the box is like a house, the girl is like a Greek caryatid holding up the roof . . . I've always liked the hardness and softness combined, this wedding of organic and geometric."
 
 Sitting directly on the floor, like a Minimalist sculpture, Mitumba Deity consists of lumpy bundles of fabric, stuffed toys, and articles of clothing. Composed of Smith’s own garments and those of friends, the piece alludes to the global economy through the path of secondhand clothing. The piece was inspired by a film that tracks a T-shirt with a university logo from a thrift shop in New York to a mountain village in Africa, where it is purchased by a man and becomes his second shirt. Mitumba is a Swahili word that literally means “bundles” and refers to the packages and articles of used clothing donated by people in prosperous countries to charitable causes. Mitumba Deity is from Smith’s series of bundle sculptures.
 Combining a Minimalist-inspired aesthetic with a love of ordinary materials such as drinking straws, pencils, adhesive tape, and paper plates, Donovan creates delicate but monumental sculptures that evoke forms found in nature. To compose this work, she rolled sheets of Mylar to form cones and then glued these smaller units together to create molecular modules. Characteristically, Donovan exploits the properties of her material—in this case, the reflective surface of Mylar, which responds to light in different ways.
 In this piece, spelled out in sparkling coal crystals are the words “something in me wondered ‘What will happen to all that beauty?’” This quotation from a 1962 essay by James Baldwin (reprinted the following year in the volume The Fire Next Time) is set over a blurred black-and-white image from the Million Man March, a gathering of black social activists in Washington, D.C., in 1995. The accumulation of crystals suggests the mass of participants in this historical event as viewed from above, while the juxtaposition of Baldwin’s text and the image of the march—cultural events separated by over three decades—reminds us of the still-ongoing dialogue about race in America.
 Snoop Dogg is part of Andres Serrano's series America. It attempts to document the current social reality of the U.S.A. In addition to Snoop Dogg, the series includes images of such diverse personalities as a Playboy Bunny, a homeless man, a firefighter, a street vendor, a boy scout, and an assistant at an investment bank. Undertaking the series in response to the shock of 9/11, Serrano set out to answer the question of who we are and what the diversity of America actually looks like. He captures the humanity of his subjects while at the same time the scale of the figures, as they are positioned within the picture frame, gives them almost heroic proportions.
 In this drawing each Lakota woman wears elaborate regalia and carries a fan and a pouch, items used to decorate and honor horses. Warriors and horses in battle are depicted on their clothing. According to the artist, Horse Nation “honors ‘tasunka wakan’ (the horse) for its importance for the Lakota People. The horse allowed them to increase their mobility for hunting, expand their territory, strengthen their ‘akicita’ (protective warrior societies), improve their economy, relieve their burdens, and, most importantly, gave women someone else to love.”
 The New York artist JoAnne Carson’s Bouquet is a big, fantastic representation of a floral arrangement. Its stems are assembled from copper, fiberglass, and resin, bolted to a base of steel, while the individual flowers and leaves are made from thermoplastic, which becomes stiff when dry. Despite the rigidity of the materials, the overall effect is one of fragile beauty, heightened by the delicate turquoise and purple-blue color of the blooms. With its mixture of recognizable and imaginary flowers, this very decorative, oversize piece conveys a sense of otherworldly fantasy.
 Always interested in changing identities, Cindy Sherman consistently acts as her own model. Her photographs depict female characters and usually imply a narrative outside of the picture frame. Sherman’s visual vocabulary is shaped by American culture, and her characters are inspired by types from film, fashion, television, and advertising. The photographs in this group portray women outside of the domestic sphere, distant from traditional female roles as mothers and wives. Untitled Film Still #38 shows a woman cautiously wading into a stream, her posture suggesting that this excursion has a purpose, a goal to be reached within the story. The blurred composition is the result of Sherman’s first experimentation with a heavy telephoto lens, which weighed the camera down on the tripod and altered the focus. Sherman welcomes this element of chance in her work.
 
 Shown in 1972 at the De Luxe Black Arts Center in Houston, one of the first U.S. exhibition spaces to place the work of artists of color alongside that of their white peers, Power Flight takes an experimental approach to painting, moving it off the wall and into three-dimensional space. Freed from the confines of a stretcher, the canvas, composed of five connected triangles, is pulled taut by ropes. The resulting shape suggests nomadic shelters, easily assembled and disassembled by individuals fleeing harm. Using the colors of the Pan-African flag, Joe Overstreet connects metaphors of flight and nomadism to transnational struggles for black liberation.Committed to both experimental art-making and socio-political engagement, the artist notes that his life and work have been "tied up in abstract shape with what black [people] have felt and struggled." In 1973 he and his wife founded Kenkeleba House, a New York gallery focused on artists underrepresented by mainstream institutions.
 Petah Coyne’s fantastical forms, presenting a beauty that slides into the grotesque, allude to death and decay. Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculpturesproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works—the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.Coyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.

 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.

 C. C. Wang, a renowned scholar and collector of Chinese art, was trained in classical Chinese painting in Shanghai before settling in New York in 1947. His paintings drew upon Chinese conventions while reflecting his engagement with modern Western art. This particular work continues the long tradition in which mountain imagery expresses the vast forces of nature and man’s place in the cosmos. Yet, with his expressionistic painting of massive granite cliffs and dramatically lit storm clouds, Wang achieves a new portrayal of the venerable landscape theme.
 Lynn Hyman Butler’s Coney Island Kaleidoscope series combats the idea of Coney Island as a time capsule of nostalgia. During a period of crime and political and financial instability, artists such as Butler considered the site’s uncertain fate as a subject for their work. Saturated colors glide through these playful images, taken while Butler was physically in motion, emulating the vision of a visitor in flux on an amusement park ride. The figures in these two photographs stride forward boldly in contemporary attire: sundresses and straw hats, and leather vests with tattooed arms. The vibrant energy and sense of movement and chaos reject sentimentality, alluding to the velocity of time. Butler is interested in conveying the rush of disorder and the change from past to present Coney Island, and aims to signal the need for historic preservation in its future.
 At the time that Steeplechase closed in 1964—a victim of rising crime, neighborhood decline, and competing entertainment—a new amusement park, Astroland, had already been established for a few years between Surf Avenue and the boardwalk west of West Tenth Street. This park carried on the Coney tradition during the following decades. In 1983, the not-for-profit corporation Coney Island USA was created to assist in rejuvenating Coney Island’s amusement life. It developed many of the programs that later generations of visitors recognize, such as the Mermaid Parade, Sideshows by the Seashore, and concerts on the boardwalk. Lynn Butler’s dynamic take on the site in her Coney Island Kaleidoscope series documents a gritty and still spectacular Coney Island.
 For her series Coney Island Kaleidoscope, Lynn Hyman Butler photographed while in motion “to capture the sense of time passing.” The resulting effect produces dreamscapes saturated with color: riderless kiddie horses hypnotically glide in The Red Horse; a teenager holds either a toy gun or the real thing in The Girl with a Gun. Butler wants her photographs to serve as reminders that “the decision of whether to save or relinquish landscapes such as these will be of increasing urgency.” The nighttime scene behind the gun-toting girl features neon signs for the famous El Dorado Carousel, the Wonder Wheel, and the Cyclone, which alert the viewer to the potential dangers of demolition and development — to what can still be lost.

 In the portfolio Samar Hussein Vera Lutter commemorates the civilian deaths caused by the war in Iraq since the invasion on March 20, 2003. The title derives from the name of the thirteen-year-old Iraqi girl who was the first recorded civilian casualty. Lutter adopts images of a hibiscus flower’s life cycle, from the opening of the bud to the blossom’s final disintegration, as a metaphor of the transience of human existence. The petals’ reds, pinks, and ivories, which mimic the tones of human flesh, further underscore the comparison.
 This photograph is part of Mitch Epstein’s series Family Business, which traces the decline of Holyoke, Massachusetts, a once-prosperous industrial town, through the example of his own family’s waning fortunes. The series becomes a metaphor for many small American towns in flux, depopulated and with jobs in short supply.Walls darkened by soot, Apartment 304, 398 Main Street shows a building belonging to Epstein’s father that was condemned after a fire. Yet the image also forms a stunning still life—an emblem of the fragility of life.
 Anthony Goicolea’s Ice Storm depicts a frigid, fable-like place, an ambiguous and unsettling enchanted forest where a group of young men, seemingly knitting and some of them masked, gather in isolation. Inspired by myths, fairytales, dreams, and childhood fantasies, Goicolea’s image, part of a series called Sheltered Life, is a mysterious landscape partly constructed by the artist with the help of digital technology. Like the other images from this series, Ice Storm focuses on alternative living spaces in environments that often dwarf the inhabitants. The remains of an animal carcass, leftovers of an enigmatic, primeval scene, lie at the foot of the tree in the foreground, while brown bags of unknown content can be seen in several places. The beauty of icicles and ice-covered twigs, but also the dangers amid the rocky outcrops and ravines in these unforgiving and overwhelming surroundings, pose questions about this particular living arrangement.
Geometric shapes defined by densely brushed dots fill this canvas by the contemporary Australian Aboriginal artist Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungurrayi. Part of an artistic movement that began in the early 1970s with the Pintupi clan, of which he is a member, Tjungurrayi adopted the format of painting on canvas to depict what might be considered a cosmological landscape that encompasses the past, present, and future. The serpents relate to ancestors who created the waterholes, indicated by concentric circles, at a specific desert, with the background patterns representing its sand hills. These symbols are drawn from centuries-old cultural traditions of Australian indigenous peoples—including stories of creation, legends of ancestors, and daily customs—that are passed down orally or through ephemeral sand paintings.
 This mask represents Bak’was, a malevolent, ghostly spirit and the keeper of drowned souls in Kwakwaka’wakw culture. Although he is diminutive, his stride is four times the length of a man’s. He has a green, hairy body and a skeletal visage. Those drawn into the forest by him or who eat his food go mad, losing their souls and becoming part of his ghostly retinue. A soul can be saved by subduing Bak’was with menstrual blood. Bak’was appears when family ancestral masks are worn during performances of Tla’sala potlatch ceremonies, special tribal celebrations. Esta máscara representa a Bak’was, un espíritu fantasmal malévolo, guardián de las almas ahogadas en la cultura Kwakwaka’wakw. Aunque diminuto, sus pasos son cuatro veces el largo de los de un hombre. Tiene un cuerpo verde y peludo y rasgos esqueléticos. Aquellos empujados al bosque por él, o los que han comido de su comida enloquecen, perdiendo sus almas y volviéndose parte de su séquito fantasmal. El alma puede salvarse sometiendo a Bak’was con sangre menstrual. Bak’was aparece cuando máscaras ancestrales familiares se utilizan en actos de ceremonias de potlatch Tla’sala, celebraciones tribales especiales.
 ART OF INNOVATIONThese three works speak to the highly inventive history of Yoruba art. Incorporating outside materials, they each reflect how both a colonial past and global exchange shaped shifting ideas about local identity. Even this bead-embroidered crown, the ultimate symbol of Yoruba kingship, is the product of a complex global story. Although the Yoruba have a long history of glassmaking, the large, multicolored ade crown depicts figures wearing bowler hats and contains beads imported by the British in the late nineteenth century into what would soon become the Nigeria colony. The smaller beaded crown, known as an oríkògbòfó, is an evolution of the ade form, but it is modeled after the wig of a British barrister (lawyer), still worn in court today by members of the Nigerian judiciary. Yinka Shonibare, a British artist of Yoruba and Nigerian descent, used Dutch wax-printed fabric to create Skipping Girl. This material—a commodity associated with Africa but actually created in Europe, based on Indonesian designs, and sold in West Africa—serves as a symbol of the web of economic and cultural interrelationships among Africa, Asia, and Europe. Shonibare exposes cultural "authenticity" as an illusion and evokes the layers of historical connections among global cultures.
 Titus Kaphar’s The Jerome Project (My Loss) belongs to a larger series of the same title that the artist began in 2011. Searching online databases for his father’s prison record, he found dozens listed who shared his father’s first name, Jerome, as well as his surname. Struck by this discovery, he created ten-inch portraits of each Jerome, based on their mug shots. The diptych on view here shows Kaphar’s own father, at a much larger scale than in previous works in the series. Depicting African American men, who are greatly overrepresented in the prison system, the portraits are simultaneously individual and collective. The panels were painted on flat gold-leaf backgrounds and partially submerged in tar. Initially, the level of the tar reflected the percentage of each lifetime spent in prison, but Kaphar abandoned this formula in acknowledgment of incarceration’s lingering aftereffects, such as difficulty securing employment and loss of voting rights. The portraits draw on the visual tradition of Byzantine icons, specifically depictions of Saint Jerome, patron saint of students, librarians, and scholars.
 ART OF SATIREMasks are particularly useful for expressing disapproval and thus reinforcing communal values. These two masks performed instructional and critical messages about proper behavior and political discontent. Male Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. This mask depicts a French gendarme, a colonial soldier, and was most likely performed as a critique of French personal and political behavior during the colonial period. The mask depicting Elvis Presley belonged to the Nyau society (to which all Chewa men belong), an institution that governs the spiritual realm of death and the ancestors. The society’s masks always represent the spirits of the deceased, but they may also represent wild bush spirits or caricature personalities from the wider community. Outsiders—including Swahili slave traders, British officials, the Virgin Mary, and other iconic foreigners such as Elvis Presley— have been considered representative of antisocial traits and undesirable values.
 Today covered in a coat of red paint, the steel tower of the Parachute Jump is the only remaining sign of Steeplechase Park. In the years during and after World War II, riders were hoisted to the top of the tower in a canvas seat attached to a closed parachute. When they were dropped from the top, only the parachute would slow the descent. Like the Wonder Wheel, the Cyclone, and Childs Restaurant, the tower is now protected by its landmark status and will remain at Coney Island even after the redevelopment of the area. Like several other steel structures that made their way to Coney Island, the Parachute Jump originated as a ride at a world’s fair (in this case, the 1939 New York World’s Fair), reflecting the often-utopian nature of the ventures that developed Coney Island over its history.
 Morrison Cousins, a noted American industrial designer, was hired by the houseware company Tupperware to redesign its ubiquitous kitchen food storage vessels in the 1980s. This strikingly reductivist tazza also was designed by Cousins, but not for retail; it was a limited-edition incentive award for Tupperware distributors in Japan.
 In the postwar period Coney Island remained an almost obligatory subject for most photographers visiting or living in New York. New and more affordable lightweight cameras allowed photographers to be freer in the exploration of their topic. Brooklyn-born Stephen Salmieri had just graduated from School of Visual Arts in New York when he started his Coney Island series in 1966. Working in the tradition of many mid-twentieth-century independent photographers (such as Robert Frank and Lisette Model) who found Coney Island an inspiring subject, Salmieri spent the following six years documenting a decaying area, still full of life. Last summer there was still a limited stretch of concession stands on the Bowery, not much different from the ones in Salmieri’s suite of images. Even though some barkers are now relying on electronic amplification to lure passersby to their games, the original intention remains the same.
 Glenn Ligon’s work, known for its stenciled quotes, often blends reportage, words, and images in ways that challenge traditional classification. The artist explores issues surrounding race, sexuality, politics, and representation. In 2003 he discovered that one of his earlier print projects, featuring text from the author Zora Neale Huston’s 1928 essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me,” had not been cancelled by the printer. Cancellation of a series (by marking the plates with an X) ensures that no unauthorized copies of an artist’s work are executed. For Untitled (Cancellation Prints), Ligon himself cancelled the plates by drawing large drypoint Xs on them but then authorized an edition from them. The artist stated, “Cancelled but present, new but haunted by the ghosts of their earlier meanings, the prints speak to the mutability of questions of racial identity and a shift in the cultural context in which the original works were received.”
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Relate to Your Heritage combines the visual language of psychedelic posters with multiple fragments of African American female figures, constructing a culturally specific articulation of femininity and power. Both this work and Eyes of Time point to the importance of the feminine form in linking a collective mythic history to present-day autonomy and power. Barbara Jones-Hogu was a founding member of AfriCOBRA, a movement of visual artists formed in 1968 that sought “an approach to image making which would reflect and project the moods, attitudes, and sensibilities” of African American self-determination.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 Wayne Higby calls upon the western landscape of his childhood to create works that pay homage to the grandeur of nature and create a focal point for meditation. In the “Trapped Terrace Gap” Bowl the fracture of the ground represented on the outside wall of the piece is continued on the opposite inside wall. Seen from the proper angle, this natural feature jumps the “canyon” of the void between the walls. At the same time, the earthenware bowl is made from the very earth it represents.
 Using Coney Island as a setting, the photographer John Murphy created tableaux that captured the bleakness of the lives of fictional sideshow and carnival people. Here, a woman straddling a wooden chair faces a painted banner advertising her act at Coney Island’s Lido Theater, which closed in the 1970s. The contrast between her former glory as a performer and her current reality, emphasized by the empty room, is stark.
 A seemingly endless stretch of empty beach underscores the tranquility of this scene photographed by Harvey Zipkin. A small African American congregation heads to the water for a baptism. In the distance sits the Half Moon Hotel, a once popular Coney Island venue that was demolished in 1996, two years after this image was taken.

 During the last decade of his life, Philip Guston made paintings that combined the imagery of his early murals with the gestural brushstroke of his abstract painting of the 1950s. He created narratives in a cartoon-like style, returning repeatedly to certain motifs, all evident here: the solitary light bulb, severed arms and legs, horseshoes, and the soles of hobnailed boots. Brushed in broad strokes and a vivid red palette, the objects set against a curtain in an interior space allude to tragic events, both personal and in the wider world.
 With a kaleidoscopic array of brilliant colors and bold geometric patterns, Romare Bearden evoked the mystery and vitality of African spiritual traditions in Wizard’s Domaine. Although there is no clear narrative, the white-robed figure at right seems to be entreating the winged character of the wizard, gazing down on his domain from the sky. The remainder of the composition is densely packed with the forms of a building, other figures and animals, and plants, as well as abstract symbols and decorative passages.Throughout his career, Bearden was particularly interested in the African American experience, but he also believed that a universal “prevalence of ritual” united people across generations and cultures. He drew stylistic inspiration from a variety of sources, including African art, Cubist and Dadaist collage, jazz music, and Caribbean landscapes.This work has been placed on view as part of Romare Bearden: 20th Century American Master, a centennial tribute organized by the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Romare Bearden Foundation. Events and installations nationwide mark the hundredth anniversary of Bearden’s birth. For more information, visit beardencentennial.org. To find out where to view other Bearden artworks in the tristate area between now and September 2012, visit studiomuseum.org.Born in North Carolina, Bearden moved to Harlem with his family in 1920. He produced his earliest work as a cartoonist for school publications at Boston University and New York University. While at NYU, he took art classes at the Art Students League. Following his service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Bearden studied philosophy in Paris, where he came into contact with modernist artists. Back in New York, he supported himself as a songwriter and a social worker in the early 1950s and then resumed his work as an artist in the 1960s. He was a founding member of Spiral, a collective of African American artists formed in 1963 to explore their role in American art and society. During this period, Bearden began making the widely acclaimed collages that became the hallmark of his oeuvre.
 The proportions of this piece by the prominent installation artist Pepón Osorio are rather ambiguous: the two giant stuffed cats seem to be too large for the narrow table on which they sit. This incongruity reflects the artist’s recollections of visiting his mother’s apartment, filled with knickknacks and figurines, when he was an art student. The objects were in sharp contrast with the aesthetic values of the art world he was entering, and his conflicting feelings of repulsion and attraction assumed giant dimensions in his mind.
 This coiled basket is anything but traditionally executed. It was created especially for the Museum by the artist. Around the exterior it depicts eleven different women, each wearing the traditional dress of her tribe or nation. Each woman holds a three-dimensional basket woven in the style of her people and, facing outward, presents it to the world. The circle of women is repeated on the interior, where they compose a community of basket makers and present their baskets to each other.
Worn during spectacular night dances, this helmet mask represents a leaf spirit, one of the many bush spirits depicted by kavat bark-cloth masks.The mask is formed by stretching bark cloth over a thin cane frame. The pigments that decorate these masks have general symbolic associations: red with masculinity, reminiscent of the flames through which the mask dances at night; black with femininity, the soot of cooking fires, and fertile earth; and white with the spirit world.
 In radical contrast to George Bellows's dynamic scenes of New York City's industrial and architectural transformation, this depiction of laborers on the California shoreline shifts his focus to the elemental drama of man and horse in working partnership. The painting was well reviewed in New York soon after it was completed, with one critic deeming it a continuation of the "epic manner of Winslow Homer."
 Like many 1920s figure painters, Lorser Feitelson attempted to interpret the ideal, or perfected, human form in a distinctly modern way. In this mythological subject, he based the exuberantly contoured figures and complex, dance-like composition on the elongated figures and virtuoso compositions of sixteenth-century Italian Mannerism and its nineteenth-century French heir, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Working in Paris, Feitelson no doubt was aware that Pablo Picasso had already moved in this direction, creating beautifully outlined figures inspired by classical sculpture and Renaissance painting. Although this work’s chalky, fresco-like colors also refer to Renaissance art, the figures are lithe, athletic, and unmistakably modern.
 The undulating lines of the wooden bowl shown here evoke a jellyfish in motion, or a leaf curling in the summer sun. Russel Wright experimented with these curving, biomorphic shapes in several media and clearly found them interesting in their own right. Although neither easy to make nor particularly suited to their purpose, these bowls were, however, wonderfully playful and suggestive of nature to the consumers he targeted.
 These two paintings by Aleksandr Yakovlev show the artist’s key role in ushering in a new classicism in post- Revolutionary Russian art. Yakovlev trained at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts but traveled at a young age to Italy and Spain, where he applied the light and modeling of the Old Masters to modern subjects. Unable to return to Russia after the outbreak of the October Revolution, Yakovlev settled in Paris but continued to travel across the globe, immersing himself in world cultures. Arab Merchant was painted in Tunisia.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.

 The modernist poet Marianne Moore is readily recognizable here by her slender face and neck, her elongated fingers, and her signature mannish dress. Notwithstanding the reductive and linear approach to form in this portrait, it crackles with personality, conveyed through the artist’s use of expressive lines and physical distortions, particularly in the hands.Marguerite Zorach and Moore were both involved in New York City’s vanguard cultural circles and admired each other’s works. Zorach’s richly colored paintings and embroideries served as the source of inspiration for Moore’s poem “In the Days of Prismatic Color” (1923).
 David Smith's The Hero conflates the abstract and the figurative, for discernible in this geometric steel sculpture is a life-size female. She is revealed frontally, balanced on a pedestal, with a rectangle for a torso, two triangular forms for breasts, and fragments of a tank top for a head. The Hero is a forerunner of more than ten sculptures produced between 1952 and 1960 that Smith titled his Tanktotem series. "Tank" refers to the industrial tank lids or boiler tops he used to construct his pieces, while "totem" may indicate the influence of Sigmund Freud's book Totem and Taboo.
 The coiling inner structure of Seymour Lipton’s Earth Forge II suggests the processes hidden within both the natural world and the human mind. As the artist said: “What goes on behind the flower in the bud, what goes on in wintertime under the ground, what goes on in the hidden recesses of the human heart and the human mind, these things are very real to me.” The inner world of nature becomes a refuge from the hustle and bustle of 1950s America.
 With its male figure seated on a schematic throne, Personnage is likely related to Bacon’s paintings from the early 1950s inspired by Diego Velázquez’s mid-seventeenthcentury portrait of Pope Innocent X. This canvas, which shows traces of an earlier image through the thickly applied pigment, appears to be one of many that Bacon abandoned before completion. A 1982 letter from the artist to the Brooklyn Museum reveals that Bacon discarded the painting in 1956–57, considering it a failure. He gave it to an artist friend, who apparently did not follow through on his intention to obliterate the image and paint on the other side. Here, as in Bacon’s many other unfinished canvases, the power of the artist’s vision still makes itself felt.
 Luigi Lucioni and Paul Cadmus probably met as students, and they doubtless shared acquaintances within New York’s circles of gay artists and writers. Lucioni’s likeness of Cadmus celebrated the shared passion of two young moderns for the ideal forms of Italian Renaissance art, particularly the paintings of Piero della Francesca. Within a modern close-up format, he captured a gaze that is at once tentative and mesmerizing.
 
 The story of Aladdin and his magical lamp enjoyed considerable popularity with U.S. theater audiences during the early twentieth century, as did productions with ornate costumes, elaborate sets, and Asian acting troupes, often performing in pantomime. In this image of the Korean actor Pilgun Yoon in the role of Aladdin, Albert Herter (son of Christian Herter of the American furniture firm Herter Brothers, whose cabinet is nearby) referred to the strict frontal poses of formal Chinese portraiture. His interest in a decorative aesthetic is evident in the robe’s elaborate pattern, based on Chinese Qing dynasty court dress.
 Decorated doors are found throughout West Africa, each area having its own distinct style. Often such doors mark the homes of important people, such as rulers or religious leaders. This door, darkened from years of use, is ornamented with a carefully balanced combination of curvilinear and angular designs. The attached lock is decorated to match the door.
 ART OF THE BODYThese five artworks from throughout the African continent display the range of approaches artists have taken to figural representation. They prove that the Western tradition of naturalism— depicting the body precisely as observed in life—is not even remotely the only possibility open to an artist. The Mossi mask celebrates the female form. While it is not an exact replica of the body, the proportions are relatively balanced. The Yoruba tapper, used with a board to draw images during divinations, was carved with more exaggerated proportions, partly in order to contain it within the functional form of a tapper and the shape of the ivory from which it was carved. The Fang figure, a masterpiece by a known artist or workshop, has primarily been reduced to a series of basic shapes—cylinders and circles. The legs and hips are conceived as the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders, echoing the cylindrical reliquary box on which the figure sat. The small Nsapo-Nsapo work and the Chamba figure take the abstraction of the human form even further by greatly exaggerating the proportions. The Nsapo-Nsapo example's stretched arms and the Chamba sculpture's outsized hands suggest different emotional states for these two protective figures—a tense anxiety, perhaps, in one and a lumbering aggression in the other.
 Oqwa Pi (Abel Sanchez) was one of several promising painters who learned the basics of mural painting and watercolor at the Santa Fe Indian School. Moving back to San Ildefonso Pueblo, he led an active life as a religious leader and statesman, holding the position of Tribal Governor for six terms. In addition to raising his large family and fulfilling his extensive community obligations, he maintained a successful artistic career, fitting in his painting between feast days and using his dining room as a studio. His work features scenes of secular ceremonies and, as seen here, of his community’s daily life.
 This painting depicts the performers of the Hopi Corn Dance. Louis Lomayesva omitted the background in his images, thereby emphasizing the figures while adding a timeless quality. His paintings nevertheless mirror reality, as seen here in the fine details of the woven designs on the dancers’ shawls and belts. Lomayesva was one of several artists who incorporated traditional Native painting styles from hides, pottery, and murals with the European-derived medium of watercolor to create a new Native American art form.
 This painting depicts the performers of the Fall Corn Dance. Waldo Mootza omitted the background in his images, thereby emphasizing the figures while adding a timeless quality. His paintings nevertheless mirror reality, as seen here in the fine details of the woven designs on the dancers’ skirts, the body decorations on the clowns, and the raised banner over the leaders.Mootza was one of several artists who incorporated traditional Native painting styles from hides, pottery, and murals with the European-derived medium of watercolor to create a new Native American art form.
 The furnishings exhibited at the Paris 1925 International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts were a cause for great excitement and inspiration for designers and consumers alike, who looked forward to the future in the wake of the First World War. Hammond Kroll, who was interested in American Colonial furnishings and began cabinetmaking at age twenty-two, was one of the designers who, by his own account, were "fired up" by the Paris exhibition. During his brief career in furniture design, between 1927 and 1939, Kroll crafted high-quality sparsely decorated elegant furniture such as this chair, part of a suite given to the Museum.
 This piece of jewelry illustrates the transition from the more conservative handmade jewelry of the Arts and Crafts style to the modernist jewelry that embraced the abstraction of the twentieth century. Charles Price was a metalsmith at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan, founded in imitation of the Bauhaus in Germany to teach good design coupled with handcraftsmanship. In the 1930s, as Price was creating this necklace, Alexander Calder, the wellknown American sculptor, began to create jewelry that spoke in the modernist idiom shared by Arthur Smith and the other jewelers.
 An oshe shango, or dance wand, is carried by devotees at the annual festival for Shango, the god of thunder and lightning. The double ax-blade motif on the figure's head represents a thunderbolt, associated with the sudden, overwhelming, and unpredictable power of of Shango. The female figure balancing the thunderbolts on her head represents a devotee of the god.
 Taken in 1940, these photographs capture women in Harlem who rejected the limitations of domesticity. In Street Scene 2, there is a clear assertiveness about the standing woman, with her left arm holding a stack of newspapers and her right hand on her hip. In Lady and Lamp, the subject’s reclining posture and distanced gaze are juxtaposed with her formal attire, suggesting the need to unwind after a long day of work. Like other New York City neighborhoods at the time, Harlem was still recovering from poverty, overcrowding, and other devastating symptoms of the Great Depression. Details in these photographs, such as the ripped fabric on the arms of the chair and the “Furnished Room” si, hint gently at the harsh conditions that these modern urban women were up against.
 Anna Mary Robertson Moses—better known as Grandma Moses—began painting in her late seventies, after decades of working on a farm. Early Skating is one of more than 1,500 of her paintings that depict the seasonal activities and landscape of her rural community in upstate New York. As is characteristic of the artist’s distinctive style, the action is concentrated in the lower half of the composition, and the figures are described in flat, reductive shapes with minimal details.
 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer. Seedpod rattles and metal bells added a musical aspect to the performance.Although they are danced by Luvale men, mwana pwevo masks depict women. In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.

 These large keystones of male heads wearing garlands of grapevines represent satyrs (mythological creatures that are part human and part animal) or, perhaps, Bacchus, the god of wine in classical mythology. Their lively visages once adorned the facade of the Park Lane Hotel at Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Streets in Manhattan. The fourteen-story building was demolished in 1966.

 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place.

 The lower portion of this drum is decorated with relief carvings of spirals and concentric arcs that were originally painted white and red. The large face, with its projecting tongue, is meant to be threatening, indicating the power of the clan that owned it. Above and below the face are two cassowary birds.This drum is closely related to three other published examples, which all may be by the same artist. All were collected at the beginning of the twentieth century. The design is reportedly that of a Chambri drum captured by the Iatmul people and then used to celebrate their victory. This type of drum, which originally had a membrane covering the top, provides accompaniment for clan songs on ceremonial occasions such as funerals, the launching of new canoes, or the completion of a clan house.
 “I think a view from my window would make an interesting composition,” Grace Hartigan wrote the year she painted East Side Sunday. At the time, Hartigan was living and working on the Lower East Side, a colorful neighborhood filled with tiny shops huddled among fruit stands, pickle and herring vendors, antique storefronts, and bakeries. The energetic brushstrokes, vibrant bursts of color, and stirring shapes in this painting render the artist’s observations with an imaginative and fragmented sense of movement.
 The daughter of prosperous Swiss immigrants, Marie Zimmermann was born in Brooklyn and studied art at the Art Students League and Pratt Institute. Although she was often influenced by Asian and ancient Egyptian art, which she no doubt saw on visits to the Brooklyn Museum, these candlesticks illustrate an affinity with the restrained Anglo-American interpretation of the Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Zimmermann and Elizabeth Copeland, the maker of the nearby box, were among the few women metalsmiths to achieve national fame.

 A keen observer of the mundane routines of domestic life, Bonnard simultaneously conveys both familiar intimacy and isolating distance in the shared space of this cheerful breakfast room. While the vantage point implies a place for the viewer across from the seated woman, the austere jutting wedge of the white tablecloth and the placement of the basket of fruit set her apart. Moreover, with her head and shoulders bowed over her cup, the woman stirs her drink with meditative self-absorption. Bonnard further underscores the detachment of the figures with the turned back of the retreating child.
 In this chair, George Nelson experimented with the same materials and forms as did his contemporaries, but with a different result. The fiberglass shell of his chair is two-toned, with a sweeping void between the two sections, deliberately denying the unity to which other designers aspired. Nelson ran a large design firm, and many of the works attributed to his office were actually designed by employees. This chair was probably created by Charles Pollack.
 Although one of the twentieth century's most prolific creators of handmade jewelry, William Spratling stood consciously outside the modernist movement thatt flourished during his career. Trained as an architect, he was introduced to the idea of jewelry making during sojourns in Mexico beginning in 1926. In 1929 he moved to Taxco, Mexico, the site of centuries-old silver mines, and set up a company of local artisans to revive the art of silver hollowware and jewelry. His designs were inspired primarily by pre-Columbian motifs. This venture became an enormous success, especially during World War II and immediately after when department stores in the United States were cut off from European suppliers of luxury goods. Unfortunately, Spratling lost control of his company to other investors, and by 1946 Spratling y Artesanos was out of business. Thanks to his apprenticeship system, however, his legacy continues in Mexico today.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Shunkahmolah, a leader of the Black Bear clan priesthood, showed this headdress to the ethnologist Francis La Flesche and Brooklyn Museum curator Stewart Culin when they visited him in 1911. According to Osage consultants, the headdress was used in ritual preparations for the hunt.The Osage cosmos is composed of an invisible creative force, called Wakonta, that is ever-changing within an ordered cosmos constructed with four major, interwoven divisions: sky, earth, day, and night. The sky is associated with north, the left side, and the male gender. Earth is allied with the south, the right side, and the female gender. Day is linked to the east, the sun, life, birth, the male gender, and the color red. Night is connected to the west, the moon, destruction, the female gender, and the color black. Regalia worn by the Osage people often symbolically reflect the complex elements of their cosmos.The kingfisher attached to the back of the headdress symbolically unites the Osage Sky and Earth people, since the bird flies in the sky and hunts in the water. The bird also unites the male (sky) and female (earth) forming the left and right side of the Osage universe. The northern harrier and red-tailed hawk feathers attached to the trailer are symbolic of the sun or life and give the hunter the power to move quickly and effectively.
 At the beginning of the twentieth century, upper-class Mangbetu women wore a small banana or plantain leaf bustle (called a negbe) in the back to cover their buttocks. The women appliqued delicately cut and colored pieces of leaves atop an oval pad built up of layered plantain leaves. A similar but smaller object (called a nogetwe) was worn in the front over a belt to fasten a piece of bark cloth in place as a frontal covering.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).

 ART OF PRESENTING GENDERArt can play a role in articulating and enacting gender identities, both openly and more subtly. This stool and figure display their respectively male and female bodily sexual characteristics quite directly. The stool would have been used by a Lobi man of high status, with its phallic “foot” protruding to convey his virility and authority. The figure, dedicated to the Yoruba cult of Shango, the orisha (god) of thunder, emphasizes female characteristics of breasts and hairdo. In addition, the bowl held by the figure has sexual and reproductive associations. The two headrests are everyday objects with the same function, though their differing forms are based on the gender of the user. The blocklike form of the man’s headrest contrasts with the more slender form of the woman’s. Even everyday objects such as these can subtly reinforce a strict, binary concept of gender. In addition to cradling the head and protecting often elaborate coiffures during sleep, headrests also serve as emblems of status.

 Mbra figures are carved in the form of a baboon. They are meant to serve as a means of contacting a spirit force. The spirit is believed to possess an individual and assist that person in divining the future. The baboon form is meant to shock, intimidate, and impress with the power of the wild. To honor the spirit, offerings of blood, eggs and millet beer are made to the figure, producing the encrusted surface of this piece.
 Ethiopian CrossesChristianity most likely arrived in Ethiopia in the first century. The conversion of King Ezana in 330 c.e. led to its official acceptance and the minting of coins bearing one of the earliest uses of the cross as a Christian symbol. Although the silver pendant crosses in the Museum’s collection are from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, their forms have a considerably longer history, as the much older copper, wood, and iron crosses here demonstrate.Hand crosses, which are used by priests, are either hand-held or suspended from a cord around the neck. They are kissed by the faithful to receive a blessing. Processional crosses are carried on long poles in religious processions. Prayer staffs are used to mark rhythms during sacred dances and as supports to lean on while standing for long hours during Orthodox church services. Together, all of these crosses are emblems of the Ethiopian Orthodox church’s ongoing authority.
 Raphael Soyer had a lifelong interest in the daily lives of working-class New Yorkers. His paintings of lone women in the early 1940s suggest the absence of husbands or sweethearts who had been called up to serve in World War II. Soyer liked to depict the blank expressions of people lost in thought, leaving the meaning of the scene open to the viewer’s own interpretation. Throughout his career, his subjects conveyed a sense of weariness and disquiet—a mood related to the social isolation of modern urban life.
 Flat Surfaces, Arthur G. Dove’s last major canvas, serves as a poignant summation of his longtime quest for the “elimination of the non-essential.” Basing the composition on the view of the pond from his Long Island home, he distilled the landscape into flat, hard-edged geometric shapes that approach pure abstraction. Though an intimate of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz’s circle of modern artists, Dove preferred to live and work outside the city in proximity to nature. Considered the first American artist to produce purely nonrepresentational pictures (in 1910), he used form and color to express his deep spiritual feelings about the natural world.
 Edward Hopper established his artistic reputation in the early twenties on the basis of his watercolors, particularly his bright but stark “portraits” of the Victorian houses of Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Deceptively simple, these works demonstrate Hopper’s talent for spare compositions, as well as his exceptional control of the washes with which he suggested the brilliant effects of coastal light. In 1923, the Brooklyn Museum was the first institution to purchase a Hopper watercolor—The Mansard Roof (23.69).
 Alma Hirsig Bliss was one of many women active in the miniature revival of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. She belonged to professional organizations, exhibited widely, and won awards for her work, which included landscapes and still lifes in addition to portraits. Exemplifying the expanded repertoire of subject matter that artists explored in the miniature format, this painting allowed Bliss to showcase her skill at capturing the material properties of a range of different objects.
 Samuel Yellin was one of the most important American metalworkers of the early twentieth century. He executed metalwork for the National Cathedral in Washington, D. C., and the New York Athletic Club and Temple Emanuel in New York. Unlike the other metal pieces exhibited here, this one was never installed in a building. Rather, it was a maquette (or study) and may have been the presentation piece shown to the architects of the Federal Reserve Bank in lower Manhattan (see illustration below) to help Yellin secure the commission. The final designs of the actual metalwork in the bank, which Yellin, in the Arts and Crafts tradition, executed by hand, are closely related. Yellin was not an architect as were the designers of the other metal pieces here; rather, the Renaissance Revival style of this grille was dictated by the bold Italian Renaissance style of the bank.
 Taking full advantage of pliable fiberglass, the Pedestal armchair’s flowing lines create a unified design statement that has led to its being nicknamed the “Tulip” chair. It is the culmination of Saarinen’s experiments with molded shell forms, begun in 1940 in a collaboration with Charles Eames. The chair the two designed that year for The Museum of Modern Art’s Organic Design in Home Furnishings exhibition won an award and set the stage for innovative mid-century furniture design.
 First manufactured by Knoll in 1952, the welded-steel-rod Diamond armchair by Harry Bertoia added dynamism to modern seating. Its open frame, supporting a grid of smaller diamond shapes, glorified the use of a new industrial material. Bertoia wrote about the graceful design: “My feeling was that it had to come almost from an inward direction. . . . I began to rely once more on my own body. . . . The chairs are studies in space, form, and metal, too.” The continued success of the Diamond armchair is attributable to its seamless melding of aesthetics and practicality, seen in the best mid-century American design.
 The Yekuana of Venezuela first acquired small European glass beads through trade with the Spanish explorers who arrived in the region in 1759 and established settlements on the lower Orinoco River. Before Western clothing became fashionable, the beaded apron was the most intricate item in a woman’s wardrobe, reserved for ceremonial occasions. The trapezoidal aprons in blue, red, and white—the most popular colors—usually have geometric designs along the upper and lower edges with solid-color beadwork in between.
 These two objects were probably parts of elaborate dressing table sets that included a handheld brush, mirror, combs, small boxes, and other accessories. When the hairbrush was made, the French Art Nouveau style was new and considered avant-garde. The dense, curvilinear floral design and the female head with long, curling tresses are characteristic of that style. A generation later, this taste for curvilinear naturalism was supplanted by the French Art Moderne (or Art Deco) style of the hand mirror. Here, nature is still invoked in the decoration, but it is rendered in a more schematic, hard-edged manner that appears more modern today.
 Becoming AgainMasquerade is a moment for play—a chance to invent and experiment, even within established social needs and existing mask genres. These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.The two Bobo works share a basic form—a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns—typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.The Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.
This terracotta figure of a woman was created by the San Francisco–based African American artist Sargent Johnson in the 1930s, when black artists were deriving powerful inspiration from the New Negro Movement and its leader Alain Locke. Locke’s particular encouragement of art that celebrated black physical types and African ancestral traditions led Johnson to refer to African sculpture in the masklike form of the face. Employing a modernist reduction of form in the simplified, cylindrical body, Johnson created a work that exudes a quiet gravity and power. At midcentury, Abstract Expressionist artists including Adolph Gottlieb (whose work hangs to the right) used African-inspired forms to achieve similar effects.
 In this satirical lithograph, Mabel Dwight contrasts the violin-playing little person, whose musical talent and physical difference are on display, with Mechano, the man with movie-star looks who acts like a robot. Popular in the late 1920s, automaton sideshow performances engaged audiences in the larger debate over the place of machines in society.
 This characteristic Tiffany "dragonfly"-design lampshade features predominantly amber and blue colors. The upper portion of the lampshade is veined; the lower portion is decorated with a band of dragonflies with outspread wings overlaid in pierced bronze encircling the perimeter.
 In this striking image of a mission church that Charles Hawthorne encountered on a trip to Texas and Mexico in 1928, he used watery washes to suggest a scene bathed in brilliant southwestern light. The vivid tonalities and rapid touch of Hawthorne’s mature work in watercolor (largely from the 1920s) stand in stark contrast to the oil paintings for which he was better known—figure subjects that tended to be dark and heavily brushed. He may have found inspiration for this more liberated expression in the freely brushed and vibrant watercolors of John Singer Sargent.
 Raphael Soyer approached pastel in a relatively conservative manner, entirely covering the paper with carefully modeled forms. Elements of this composition (including the strong vertical elements that break up the space), as well as the subject of dancers, make reference to the work of the French Impressionist and progressive pastellist Edgar Degas.
 This work characterizes the new approach to the portrait miniature during its twentieth-century renaissance. Unlike the sentimental, private objects of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, revival miniatures functioned as aesthetic objects in their own right. In addition, artists emulated contemporary trends in full-scale oil painting, including loose brushwork and an interest in allover decorative patterns. The Brooklyn Museum led the way in institutional collecting of modern miniatures with the 1931 acquisition of seventeen works; as a result, the Museum’s holdings are especially strong in revival examples.
 Harold Edgerton created this photo, one of the earliest color strobe pictures ever taken, in his studio/laboratory. The kicker clenches his fist in concentration; he can’t see the ball because the studio is in total darkness. The ball is caught in the instant before it starts moving through space, where it will expand and contract on its trajectory. Edgerton was famously patient and took many photographs of the same situation to achieve his desired pictorial effect.
 Without formal training, Harry Callahan became one of the twentieth century’s most influential photographers through his investigation of light, shadow, texture, and multiple exposures. In images of cities, landscapes, and intimate portraits (mostly of his wife, Eleanor, and his daughter, Barbara), he often experimented with graphic abstraction, always infused with a personal expression. This early portrait of Eleanor combines his exploration of light with his interest in line and form. Eleanor’s face is seen in profile against the trunk of a tree. Shadows of foliage overlay her face, and the stark contrasts contribute to the flatness of the image. The Museum holds several of Callahan’s portraits of Eleanor and Barbara, as well as many cityscapes and landscapes, a large number of them in color.
 In the wake of World War I, many artists in the United States and Europe abandoned modernist experiments with fractured human form to celebrate the idealized human body in ways that signaled postwar recovery and liberation. Maurice Sterne, who had experimented with modernism after encountering the work of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse in Paris from 1904 to 1907, also took a more idealized direction in The Awakening. The figure, based in part on the nudes of Michelangelo, shows sleek, modern proportions that blend classical art and a then-fashionable slim and athletic modern body type. This type of physique is a hallmark of the twenties style, as is the figure’s “strange combination of the masculine, feminine, and child,” as Sterne himself described it.
 U-shaped pieces, a by-product of early experiments with molding plywood, made it possible to construct this freestanding, adjustable, and easy-to-carry folding screen. Each panel is an undulating form. United by full-length canvas “hinges,” the panels suggest a succession of waves reaching the shoreline.The FSW screen proved labor-intensive to produce, and it was discontinued in 1956. The piece shown here is unusual for its ebonized veneer and ten-panel width, rather than the typical eight.
 In 1948, the husband-and-wife design team of Michael and Frances Higgins began producing glass using a technique in which warm, pliable sheets of glass were “slumped” over molds, decorated with bits of enamel, foil, or wire, and then sandwiched with more glass. In this dynamic piece, the walls of the bowl comprise enlarged cellular forms that look as if they may multiply at any moment.
 This folding lounge chair was made as the deck chair for the SS United States ocean liner, launched in 1952. The ship, which soon achieved the record for the fastest Atlantic crossing, cost a staggering seventy-eight million dollars and was noteworthy for its extensive use of aluminum and its modern décor. The Troy Sunshade Company was an American firm that pioneered the manufacture of tubular steel furniture in the 1930s and then aluminum furniture in the postwar period. Hundreds of these chairs were made for the liner and remained with the ship until 1984, when the fittings and furniture were auctioned. The ship is now docked in Philadelphia awaiting refurbishment.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 This iconic pitcher was famously inspired by the prow of the legendary Normandie ocean liner, which quickly became the epitome of modernity. The interiors of this speedy ship were designed by the leading French proponents of the Art Moderne, or Art Deco, style, characterized by hard-edged silhouettes and stylized decoration.
 Marsden Hartley occasionally painted imaginary portraits of historical figures such as this one of John Donne, the seventeenth-century English metaphysical poet and dean of Saint Paul’s Cathedral in London. The solemn portrait is based on an engraving of Donne’s carved tomb effigy that was the frontispiece for a collection of his sermons. The shrouded body is presented in a palette of blues and whites, cool colors evocative of death, while the striated pattern of folds approximates the hard, carved stone of the tomb.
 Although best known as an abstract sculptor, Claire Falkenstein was also an innovative jewelry maker. In fact, she considered jewelry so important that she insisted that it be shown along with her large-scale sculptures throughout her career. Her jewelry was included in several seminal modern jewelry exhibitions such as the 1948 "Second National Exhibition of Contemporary Jewelry" in Minneapolis. This piece by her shown here was evidently especially valued by the artist and remained in her possession until she died.
 In the 1930s, Aaron Siskind explored a variety of social issues in documentary-style images and created the series Harlem Document (selections from which are represented in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection). His work became abstract and metaphoric in the early 1940s, and he cultivated friendships with such Abstract Expressionist painters as Franz Kline, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, and Mark Rothko. Siskind’s photographs of graffiti, peeling plaster, sections of signs, road surfaces, and found objects marked a decisive shift in his work; exploring the properties of the medium, he flattened the picture plane, paid close attention to tonal gradation, and often drastically cropped the image. Gloucester 16A was made during a prolific period in Gloucester, Massachusetts, during the summers of 1944 and 1945. In many photographs from the Gloucester series, the shapes are unrecognizable and the shallow space is extremely compressed. This image elevates a simple section of wall into a totemic figure. Like a strange, rural Rorschach blot, the circular opening, a black void, suggests both an eye and a peephole.
 In Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, regions that acquired great wealth from the mining and trading of gold, chiefs and other people of status displayed their standing by wearing a profusion of gold ornaments, even attaching such objects to umbrellas and swords. Although many of these ornaments are abstract geometric shapes, some represent human faces or animals, including those shown here depicting a sawfish or antelope. Such works were made using the lost-wax casting method, in which a clay mold was made around a modeled wax form. The mold was then heated and the wax poured out. Finally, molten gold was poured into the mold to create a form in the shape of the original wax model.
 Today aluminum is taken for granted as a lightweight, inexpensive material that has many applications. However, it was only in 1886 that an American, Charles Martin Hall, discovered the process that made its commercial production possible. Over the next forty years, aluminum evolved from a laboratory curiosity to an industrial staple.
 Mangbetu men and women of high status traditionally wore hats made of fiber with a circular base and a rectangular or hexagonal top. They were decorated with feathers, usually from birds found in the high forest areas, but occasionally from domestic fowl, as in this example.
 Sol LeWitt was a mentor to many younger artists and writers. He was so significant to Lippard’s thinking that she dedicated Six Years to him. While his own practice always led to materialized works, he defined his artistic method as Conceptual, because he would always start from an idea, often permutations of a basic form or repetition of an operation, which he called the “machine that makes the art.” These two sketches show him elaborating the multiple forms of open cubes, and some of the various configurations possible for parallel straight lines.
 ART OF DOUBLESDuality is present in art throughout the continent as an expression of essential concepts that drive human nature—from gender to humanity’s place in the cosmos. This pair of pairs illustrates some of the ways that artists have expressed these ideas. Ere ibeji are carved by the Yoruba primarily as memorial figures for twins. Because twins are considered spiritually powerful beings, with power to provide considerable good or to inflict harm, ibeji figures are the focus of great personal interaction and care. Such figures are considered a point of access to the spirit of a departed twin, and an icon of status for a mother of twins. Worn on the heads of male dancers, ci-wara headdresses are danced in male and female pairs to symbolize the fertility of land and animals. Each headdress represents an antelope, which for the Bamana is a metaphor for the successful farmer who tirelessly tills his fields.
 Only initiates of the Koma men’s society may see the figure of the koma ba, which dances in the village to attract evil spirits that roam the bush at night. Koma ba masks are composed of a human face with a beak extending from the chin and wooden horns on the head. The horns are filled with substances that protect the wearer from sorcerer spells. The mask is heavily encrusted with blood and with chewed and expectorated kola nut; in addition, X-rays show a miniature metal bow and an arrow point as well as rifle-shell casings beneath the surface materials, all of which increase the power of the mask.

 Hospitality is an important virtue in African societies. Among the Dan, the woman with the greatest reputation for hospitality is known as a wunkirle. On public occasions, she carries as a staff of office a spoon known as a wunkirmian. The large bowl of the spoon suggests the ample quantities of rice she has given away. The ram's head commonly denotes power among the Dan, but it may also refer to the use of rams as sacrifices at the feasts over which a wunkirle presides.
 At a time when there were few professional African American artists, Nancy Elizabeth Prophet trained at the Rhode Island School of Design and carved powerful sculptures in hardwood, such as Untitled (Head). The artist, who endured decades of poverty and hunger in order to pursue her career, produced works characterized by somber dignity and idealized but expressive facial features. This sculpture is one of only about a dozen known works by Prophet still in existence.
 Consuelo Kanaga, one of the pioneers of modern American photography, began her career as a photojournalist in 1915 in San Francisco. In the 1920s, Alfred Stieglitz inspired her to develop a more aesthetic approach, and a trip to Europe in 1928 awakened her lifelong preoccupation with European modernist painting and the ways in which that work was influenced by the sculpture of Africa. Kanaga successfully combined a Pictorialist aesthetic with a realist strategy, producing handsomely composed and carefully printed images. She was one of few white American photographers in the 1930s to make artistic portraits of African Americans.In Frances with a Flower, the focus is so sharp that the slightly rough texture of the woman’s skin, shiny with perspiration at the hairline, seems palpable. The forehead, nose, and cheeks, highlighted by flash, contrast with the deep-set eyes lost in shadow, thus producing a sculptural dimension that turns the photograph into hills and valleys of light. The stark white blossom pressed to the woman’s nose emphasizes the sensuality of her face.The Brooklyn Museum held large retrospective exhibitions of Kanaga’s work in 1976 and 1993 and holds several hundred of her images in its collection.
 Depicting a cluster of smokestacks, ducts, and pipes on an ocean liner, this drawing features the kinds of mechanical and industrial imagery embraced by Precisionist artists as icons of modern America. A style that arose in the 1920s, Precisionism was characterized by simplified geometric forms and an absence of human beings. Here George Copeland Ault cropped the view of the ship’s machinery in order to focus attention on the aesthetic potential of his subject—the play of rounded and linear shapes and dark and light tones—rather than its practical function.
 After encountering French Cubism in Paris, Charles Demuth produced a large body of still-life and architectural watercolors based in a Cubist-inspired faceting of forms. Particularly drawn to the small-town American architecture of his native Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he continued to spend a significant amount of time, Demuth transposed the architectural volumes into two-dimensional designs of selected planes set off by precisely ruled lines. Within these compositions, the tones and density of his washes suggest spatial depth while areas of unpainted paper reassert the two-dimensional surface.
 The kifwebe masquerade is a genre shared by the Luba and Songye, indicative of the interaction that has occurred between the two societies. Kifwebe masks represent either male or female beings. Both mask types are characterized by angular and thrusting forms, and in both cases the entire face is covered in patterns of geometric grooves that are uniquely characteristic of these masks. Female masks, such as this one, are distinguished by the predominant use of white clay and the rounded form of the head crest.
 Although Francois Jourdain was known primarily as a painter, he was also an accomplished designer and a founding member of the Union des Artistes Modernes, an important group of avant-garde designers. This adjustable chair is rendered in the Art Moderne style, which is characterized by simple, bold curves. The use of exotic mahogany and cane alludes to the French colonial empire, still partially intact during this period. The chair was manufactured by Jourdain’s own firm, Les Ateliers Modernes.
 Blanche Lazzell made this group of objects—part of a larger suite of fourteen works—as an artistic exercise while studying in Paris with the Cubist Albert Gleizes. They provide a fascinating glimpse into Lazzell’s process of transforming a townscape into an abstract composition. The graphite drawings show her progression from a relatively representational image of an urban plaza with buildings, stairways, and trees to ever more reductive, abstract shapes that she rearranged and filled with different patterns and tones, culminating in the watercolor. This kind of experimentation allowed Lazzell to explore the expressive possibilities of abstraction, in keeping with Gleizes’s theories that the juxtaposition of flat forms—through their relation to each other and the paper surface—provides a new way to signify spatial depth.

 This spare graphite drawing of a female nude torn from a spiral notebook is one of hundreds that Louise Nevelson created—almost compulsively—between 1929 and 1934, early in her artistic career, when she was experimenting with different media. Incorporating large areas of blank paper, her reductive and distorted treatment of human anatomy emphasizes the two-dimensionality of the picture plane. This flattening effect is counterbalanced, however, by the dynamism of her jagged line and the figure’s monumentality.
 "LUNA": This single word was enough to signal to any early twentieth-century viewer that he was looking at an image of the mechanized wonder of Coney Island. The Russian-born Louis Lozowick was one of many modern artists drawn to the exciting light show of Coney Island's Luna Park, known as the Electric Eden. He combined cropped and abstracted elements of this leisure mecca's most famous attractions, including the Ferris wheel, the steeplechase ridge, and exotic illuminated minarets.
 Like many modernist portraits, this drawing displays dynamic tensions between illusionistic three-dimensionality and the flatness of the paper support, between representation and abstraction, and between individualization and idealization. George Ault reduced the forms of the head into simplified shapes, creating passages of shading that contrast starkly with the large areas of blank paper.
 ART OF SATIREMasks are particularly useful for expressing disapproval and thus reinforcing communal values. These two masks performed instructional and critical messages about proper behavior and political discontent. Male Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. This mask depicts a French gendarme, a colonial soldier, and was most likely performed as a critique of French personal and political behavior during the colonial period. The mask depicting Elvis Presley belonged to the Nyau society (to which all Chewa men belong), an institution that governs the spiritual realm of death and the ancestors. The society’s masks always represent the spirits of the deceased, but they may also represent wild bush spirits or caricature personalities from the wider community. Outsiders—including Swahili slave traders, British officials, the Virgin Mary, and other iconic foreigners such as Elvis Presley— have been considered representative of antisocial traits and undesirable values.
 As an homage to Paul Cézanne, the modernist Marsden Hartley spent a period living and working in the French artist’s favorite landscape, Aix-en- Provence, in the South of France. As Cézanne had done, Hartley depicted the distinctive profile of Mont Sainte-Victoire repeatedly. In this spare drawing, he captured the stark monumentality and sculptural contours of the mountain while using a flatter and more economical treatment for the foreground valley, where he incorporated large areas of blank paper and rendered structures in faceted planes that evoke Cézanne’s style. Although Hartley was working in front of the natural motif, he envisioned this landscape through the lens of Cézanne’s art.
 Katherine Dreier, who was president of the Société Anonyme (an organization of avant-garde artists), believed in art's potential to shape our lives. She promoted her ideas not only in such paintings as Unknown Forces, but also in essays in which she asserted that her work referred to "new cosmic forces coming to the fore which in time [would] . . .  change our vision of life as well as that of Art. "
 Beauford Delaney arranged this still-life composition as if to represent an offering to the Fang reliquary figure that appears at the right. His vivid colors and the energetic brushwork create a sense of vibration—the bowl almost appears to spin, and the figure to rock. Delaney may have seen traditional African art at the Primitive African Art Center in Manhattan or at the Brooklyn Museum.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 This exuberant ink drawing conveys the powerful energy and voluptuous eroticism of the female nude—a favorite subject of the modernist sculptor Gaston Lachaise. Here he reduced the body to a flattened outline of sinuous curves, relying on the expressive quality of his line to animate the figure. Inspired by his wife and muse, Lachaise presented a new feminine ideal that endowed the classical Venus type with modernist forms and earthy sexuality.
 Unlike many American Scene painters, Paul Sample was associated with multiple regions (Southern California and New England) and both urban and rural subjects. His pictures were highly regarded for their powerfully direct compositions that, like this barren scene, often struck a note of Depression-era melancholy. As one Art News critic observed in 1934, “[Sample] paints simply and conservatively, omitting startling devices . . . and unusual fabrications of color. There is a frank open quality to his work which is rather winning after much current showmanship and affectation.”
 One of the younger Precisionist artists, Edmund Lewandowski celebrated the industrialized landscapes of his native Midwest. In this watercolor, he reduced the factory structures of the Allis-Chalmers complex (an agricultural machinery manufactory outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin) to a flattened, abstracted arrangement of geometric shapes. Despite its limited palette and lack of a human presence, Industrial Composition evinces a sense of vitality through the syncopated patterns of lines and planes.
 By the time he immigrated to the United States in 1932, George Grosz had spent a decade painting shocking figure subjects that indicted the dissipated society and corrupt regime of Weimar Germany and led to his condemnation by Hitler’s Nazi government. Once in this country, Grosz freed himself to paint landscapes and took up watercolor. In that medium he began to experience the pure pleasure of painting with a liberated, almost calligraphic touch bearing no relation to the lurid tones and laboriously worked surfaces of his German oil paintings.
 Embracing a subject that corresponded to the natural "life" of white alabaster, the Brooklynite Robert Laurent here worked his design onto the stone surface, almost magically implying the continuation of the forms within the rock mass. In keeping with direct-carving ideals, requiring direct contact with the raw, natural material, he then hand-polished the surface to raise a brilliance and translucency from the naturally chalky stone.
 
 In the mid-1930s Mark Rothko began a series of works with subjects derived from the urban experience that became known as the Subway series. These paintings reflect the artist's sense of isolation, shared by many at the time, that resulted from the harsh social conditions caused by the Great Depression. Although figurative, these paintings accentuate the geometry underlying the elements of the city's infrastructure and thus prefigure Rothko's later concentration on rectangular shapes of luminous colors in his celebrated abstract paintings.
 The Danish-born modernist Kai Gotzsche painted this work in the American Southwest, where he spent time in the 1920s, often in the company of the writer D. H. Lawrence and a fellow Danish painter, Knud Merrild, at the Taos home of the art patron Mabel Dodge. Abstracted in a decorative manner, with simplified forms and echoes of a few key shapes, the composition is in keeping with the elegant Art Deco style that was internationally popular by the mid-1920s, particularly in architecture, decorative arts, and graphics.
 Like his teacher Charles Hawthorne, John Whorf developed as a watercolorist under the powerful influence of John Singer Sargent, whose works were frequently exhibited in the United States throughout the first decades of the twentieth century—most notably at the Brooklyn Museum. In this image of a sun-dappled cabin in rural Tennessee, Whorf emulated Sargent’s use of freely brushed washes to describe the colorful tints of shifting shadows. Sargent apparently approved of Whorf’s direction, purchasing a watercolor from the young man’s first solo exhibition, in Boston, in 1924.
 Both of these photographs, depicting portraits of royal officers and officials, have been attributed to Antoin Sevruguin, who served as a court photographer to Nasir al-Din Shah. Sevruguin’s photographic portraits are often recognized by a skillful manipulation of light and a keen attention to capturing aspects of the sitter’s personality.The portraits reveal some of the effects of Iran’s exposure to European culture in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. The two soldiers’ uniforms suggest how Iranian costume gradually incorporated European modes of dress. At right, Mirza Husayn Khan and Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir, the famed prime minister to Nasir al-Din Shah (later executed by the same ruler), are shown posing in elegant European suits. Their powerful political positions are countered by Sevruguin’s use of soft light.
 Bavarian-born Hans Hofmann settled in New York in the late 1930s. During the 1940s he became a devoted and influential teacher, especially of the first and second generations of Abstract Expressionists. In Towering Spaciousness, the artist combines strictly defined geometric forms with thickly applied, gestural areas of orange, blue, yellow, pink, and green. Blocks of color are built into towering spatial intervals. Indeed this painting well represents the artist's "push-and-pull" theory. In considering the spatial relations he created on the picture plane, Hofmann wrote in 1948: "Push and pull are expanding and contracting forces which are activated by carriers in visual motion. Planes are the most important carriers, lines and point less so."
 Although a Western form, this chest of drawers is decorated with Asian materials, bamboo and cane. At the 1876 Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia, Japan showed furniture made of these materials, and American merchants subsequently imported or made here in Brooklyn, but it is evocative indicator of the appeal of Japanism to the American market and the melding of Western and Eastern cultures.
 In Seated Faun, Janet Scudder took as inspiration the part-human, part-goat figure found in classical mythology. One of only a handful of internationally known female sculptors in America at the time, Scudder studied in Paris and became the first woman employed at the Paris studio of the sculptor Frederick MacMonnies. She later made a name for herself crafting ornamental sculptures for the formal gardens of estates designed by the architect Stanford White. Admired by White, whose firm designed the Brooklyn Museum, Scudder was even selected as the only female to produce a sculpture, Japanese Art, for the Museum’s facade.
 In this studio portrait, the Brooklyn artist Harry Edwards painted the Native American Handsome Morning, wearing a fringed shift with painted emblems, a bead-and-quill necklace, beaded moccasins, and a ceremonial blanket of fur-lined buffalo hide painted with abstract motifs (a speciality of Dakota women). Edward's identification of his sitter as a Dakota, or a Sioux, is meaningful because the Sioux retained perhaps the most lasting hold on white imaginations owing to the charismatic Ghost Dance movement. Inspired by the visions of a Paiute Indian, a wave of the Sioux communities began the practice of the Ghost Dance in the late nineteenth century to bring about the return of legions of their dead and of Sioux lands to their natural state. White fears of the movement's emotional force ultimately led to the murder of Sitting Bull and the violent confrontation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1890.
 Active in the modernist art circles of New York City during the 1920s and 1930s, George Ault moved upstate to Woodstock in 1937 for health reasons. He transferred his Precisionist idiom—with its simplified geometric forms and flat planes of color—from its usual urban industrial subjects to the rural landscape. In contrast to the cool objectivity of images by his Precisionist colleagues such as Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth, Ault’s works often resonate with melancholic emotion, evident here in the dead trees, barren field, and moody sky.
Inspired by the imposing architectural profiles and irrepressible energy of New York City, Joseph Stella completed his first painting of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1920 and returned to the theme a number of times in succeeding years. Stella used pastel as an experimental mode in which to work out his denser and highly finished modernist abstractions in oil.
 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer. Seedpod rattles and metal bells added a musical aspect to the performance.Although they are danced by Luvale men, mwana pwevo masks depict women. In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.
 Jacques Lipchitz, who had fled war-torn Paris and emigrated to America in 1941, met the modernist painter Marsden Hartley in 1942. He recalled his eagerness to do a portrait of Hartley, whose face he considered "typically American" and "very sensitive." This penetrating portrayal was done the year before Hartley's death at sixty-six and poignantly captures the painter's age and melancholy. The monumentality of the profile is in marked contrast to the wasted and drawn features of the frontal view, with its tragic overtones. Lipchitz commented that this brooding likeness of a fellow artist had been "made for myself as an exercise and demonstration." In fact, it required twenty-seven life sittings to complete Hartley's portrait. This cast, one of seven, belonged to the collectors Edith and Milton Lowenthal, who also left the Museum a rich legacy of nine paintings by Marsden Hartley.
 Louis Bouché’s portrait of the three Stettheimer sisters—from left to right, Florine, Carrie, and Ettie—evokes the whimsical decorative style and material opulence of their New York apartment, the site of a salon frequented by Bouché, Marcel Duchamp, and other figures of the artistic vanguard. Although he treated forms in a simplified and Cubist manner, Bouché imbued each of his sitters with a unique personality, conveying their eccentricity and independence. Florine was herself a successful artist, Ettie was a writer, and Carrie was a hostess and creator of a dollhouse replica of the Stettheimer home (Museum of the City of New York).
 Beginning in the late 1920s, Arthur Dove created abstract compositions inspired by natural forms and forces that he believed would be understood intuitively by the viewer. By the 1930s he was working out his compositions in this type of small-scale washes and then executed his ink drawing over them to lend a degree of clarity to the abstracted areas of color. Here a white form with a black mark suggests a dwelling near a wooded shoreline.
 The lively animation of Dong Kingman’s watercolors derives in part from his training in classical Chinese painting and calligraphy. Kingman was born in Oakland, California, to Chinese immigrants but was raised in Hong Kong, where he studied Asian and Western painting techniques. Returning to the United States during the Depression, he worked with a Works Progress Administration art program and gained wider exposure for his art, which tended to be scenic in subject.
 This female figure illustrates the ability of Dogon sculptors to translate the human form into geometric volumes. In profile, the figure's neckline, breasts, belly, buttocks, and legs are a series of diagonal lines.
 These large keystones of male heads wearing garlands of grapevines represent satyrs (mythological creatures that are part human and part animal) or, perhaps, Bacchus, the god of wine in classical mythology. Their lively visages once adorned the facade of the Park Lane Hotel at Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Streets in Manhattan. The fourteen-story building was demolished in 1966.
 The Tsogho, like other groups in Gabon, construct bundles, often decorated with carved figures, to contain the remains of important ancestors and other powerful materials. Among the Tsogho, these bundles commemorate specific ancestors. Periodically, offerings are made to the reliquary, or boumba bwiti, to honor the ancestor and other members of the lineage. Families may also use the figures during initiations.
 George Benjamin Luks occasionally painted formal portraits such as this one of the fifteen-year-old Antoinette Kraushaar (1902--1992), who posed in her grammar school graduation dress. Although her father was a respected art dealer (she followed him in the profession), she had never actually seen an artist at work before sitting for Luks. She later recalled,  "It was very interesting because you could see how he would put a strong stroke in the painting--I couldn't see the painting, but I could see him as he worked on it. At one point he said there was an awful lot of white, so he went around the studio and came up with a dusty piece of blue linen that he draped over my shoulder."
 Kuba mythology revolves around three figures, each represented by a masquerade character: Woot, the creator and founder of the ruling dynasty; Woot’s spouse; and Bwoom. Bwoom’s specific identity varies according to different versions of the myth. He may represent the king’s younger brother, a person of Twa descent, or a commoner. Embodying a subversive force within the royal court, the Bwoom masquerade is often performed in conflict with the masked figure representing Woot.
 Several types of masks are used in dances celebrating the emergence of young initiates from the Yaka circumcision camp, where boys are ritually received into Yaka manhood. Initiates hold n-khanda masks like this one to celebrate their new status as men.
 In this hand-carved work, the French-born Brooklyn artist Robert Laurent formed three organic and erotic leaf forms that stretch upward with a turning or unfurling motion suggested by the complex interplay of their silhouettes. Throughout the 1920s artists often engaged living, natural forms as surrogates for the human body in works that celebrated physical presence as an antidote to modern, mechanized lives. Among his earliest freestanding sculptures (Laurent had previously carved frames and two-dimensional reliefs), this work is one of a small handful of plant and flame subjects by the artist.
 In this drawing William Zorach abstracted the forms of a large tree and three nude figures into schematized shapes outlined with borders of parallel hatchings. The uniform treatment of humans and landscape points to the harmonious relationship he felt with nature on his annual summer retreats into the countryside. As he recalled of these idylls, “There were no problems . . . no gloomy forebodings, no literary solving of the world’s ills, only a joyous awareness of the world about us.” In addition, this drawing presents a modernist take on the traditional theme of bathers in the landscape.
 This type of egungun costume is found throughout the Oyo region of southwestern Nigeria. It consists of a length of wood balanced on the head, from which panels of cloth are suspended. Its great rectangular form completely conceals the human body, transforming the costumed wearer into a returned ancestor.Because the cloths composing the costume are of great value and prestige, they enhance the status of the families associated with the masks. The mask embodies the spirits of the ancestral dead, who reenter the community annually in swirling, whirling moments of high drama and spiritual significance.
 Beginning in 1947, Ruth Adler began designing simple modern fabrics for home furnishing. Swizzles is an example of her lively work and may take its name from the ubiquitous “swizzle stick” stuck into many a 1950s cocktail glass. The textile is full of the organic patterning that would become a hallmark of the era’s aesthetic.Adler arrived in Michigan in the mid-1940s to attend the Cranbrook Academy of Art and never left the Detroit area. Together with her husband, Edward Schnee, she established a studio and retail outlet devoted to bringing good design to the city. It was, however, her work as a textile designer for which she is best known.
 The photographer Ben Ross took this aerial view of Coney Island on July 4, 1946. The following day, the New York Times reported that 1.3 million people had visited the resort, the largest crowd in its history, to celebrate the holiday.
 This figure has been attributed to the workshop of the renowned Yoruba carver Toibo, of the town of Erin. It was probably carved in the 1920s or 1930s for the timi (king) of Ede (one of the historic Yoruba kingdoms), who kept it in a shrine dedicated to the orisha (god) Shango. Equestrian figures are potent symbols of power in many parts of Africa where ownership of horses was long restricted to warriors and political leaders. In Yoruba mythology, Shango was both a king and the orisha associated with thunder and lightning.
 The Kota believe that the bones of important men and women retain power after death, providing protection and good fortune to an individual's descendants. The bones are preserved in reliquaries made of bark or basketry. On top are placed figures known as bwiti. This bwiti typifies the Kota style. The face is covered with strips of hammered brass and copper. The neck swells into an open lozenge shape, the lower part of which is thrust into the container of bones forming its "body."
 The urban realist Reginald Marsh depicted modern New York life—burlesque theaters, crowded subways, popular beaches—in a variety of media. Watercolor allowed him to work quickly, a manner that he had developed as a newspaper and magazine illustrator. In this picture, Marsh used both dry and wet washes: note how he blurred the outline of the locomotive by letting wet paints bleed into each other in order to convey the sense of the train’s velocity as it speeds through the landscape.
 An important aspect of male competition in the Marquesas Islands, stilt games were either group races or individual competitions in which one opponent attempted to knock the stilts out from under his rival. Oral traditions record that some performers were so skilled that they were able to turn somersaults as they tested their athletic ability. During certain religious events, however, stilt demonstrations also measured a man's spiritual strength. Stilts were composed of a step attached with ornamental lashings to a shaft between five and seven feet long.
 A devoted modernist, landscape painter, and watercolorist, John Marin created compositions of partial forms—the essential elements of a view—using a rough charcoal sketch and passages of directionally applied watercolor washes that together suggest light and movement. He routinely allowed substantial areas of the paper support to remain unpainted—a technique that was usually less successful in his oils, in which he left areas of unpainted canvas exposed.
 Paul Strand was a pupil of Lewis Wickes Hine, who encouraged Strand to turn his hobby into his life’s work. After a visit to Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery in New York, Strand dedicated himself to the modernist aesthetic. Although his early interests focused on urban sites and machinery, eventually he turned to nature and portraiture in his search for purity of vision. His simple, straightforward portraits gradually became a quest for ideal beauty, seen in the inherent dignity of his subjects. Strand left the United States in the early 1950s to escape McCarthyism and lived in France for the rest of his life. He also travelled widely and spent long periods of time in Italy, the Outer Hebrides, Egypt, and Ghana. Strand turned experiences from his trips into photographic books, in which he tried to encapsulate the distinctive character of the places and the people he photographed. In this portrait from Egypt of Sheik Ali Gournah, Strand sought a precise vision of character through contrast, texture, and light. This technique expresses what he termed “an aesthetic based on the objective nature of reality.”
 To express the physical and spiritual bond between two individuals, sculptors devised a form called the pair statue. The most common variety showed the subjects—a husband and wife, a mother and child, or a king and a divinity, for example—seated together on a chair or bench. The earliest documented examples date to the reign of King Djoser in the Third Dynasty (circa 2675–2625 B.C.).This New Kingdom pair statue represents a married couple. The inscription tells us that the man is Nebsen, a scribe in the royal treasury, and the woman is Nebet-ta, a singer in the temple of the goddess Isis. They each pass one arm behind the other, a symbol closeness. In order to convey this sentiment and to create a harmonious design, the sculptor extended the arms to unnatural lengths.
 At a wide range of Baule festivals and celebrations, masks are danced and performed to entertain. This mask's delicate, symmetrical features, ornate hairstyle, and smooth surface all create an image of calm and grace. The mask is meant to exemplify an ideal of personal beauty and composure.
 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer. Seedpod rattles and metal bells added a musical aspect to the performance.Although they are danced by Luvale men, mwana pwevo masks depict women. In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.
 This mask blends features of a hornbill bird, or kuma, with the horn of a buffalo, or tu, combining animals associated with great wisdom and danger. Men wearing such masks perform at the initiation rites to men’s societies, at the funerals of important male elders, and at annual harvest ceremonies. The fact that this mask has only one buffalo horn may indicate that its design was transferred between clans, in which case the original form, with two horns, would have been slightly altered.
 This mask combines human features and those of a crocodile or shark with teeth bared. It has the tail of a chameleon, the horns and ears of an antelope, and features of less identifiable animals. Worn horizontally on top of the head, the mask is attached to a skirt of vegetal fibers that covers the body of the wearer. Banda masks were the property of the Simo men’s society, which historically oversaw and regulated fertility and initiation ceremonies. Today it is danced primarily for entertainment.
 Designed by the New York office of the Parisian decorating firm Alavoine, this elegant study, made for an elite client, was a conservative interpretation of the Art Deco style; this can be seen in the geometric paneling of palisander and olive wood veneers and the large abstract lacquer panel, designed by Henri Redard and executed by Jean Dunand. A small, concealed bar, with etched glass walls that salute France, is hidden in the corner in defiance of Prohibition, which forbade alcohol consumption in the United States from 1919 to 1933. Interestingly, while this room was furnished in the Art Deco style, the public rooms in the rest of the Worgelt apartment were furnished in a more conservative French eighteenth-century-revival style.
 Kananginak, son of Eegyvudluk Pootoogook, made this print from a drawing by his father. The subject alludes to Inuit knowledge of the interconnected workings of their environment. This print was included in the first graphics collection produced by Cape Dorset Graphics of the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, an organization created to promote Inuit art. An exhibition of the first thirty-nine prints toured Canada and the United States to great critical acclaim in 1959, leading to a continuation of the printmaking program, which is still active today.
 Osuitok Ipeelee created this lively print of four musk oxen racing across the frozen tundra. It was part of the first graphics collection produced by Cape Dorset Graphics of the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, an organization started by James Houston (an artist and Northern Services Officer of the Canadian government) in 1959 to secure recognition of Inuit artists and economic opportunities for Native people. The prints of the collection were produced by an Inuit committee from drawings submitted by Native men and women. The first exhibition of thirty-nine prints toured Canada and the United States to great critical acclaim, leading to a continuation of the printmaking program, which is still active today.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 ART OF DOUBLESDuality is present in art throughout the continent as an expression of essential concepts that drive human nature—from gender to humanity’s place in the cosmos. This pair of pairs illustrates some of the ways that artists have expressed these ideas. Ere ibeji are carved by the Yoruba primarily as memorial figures for twins. Because twins are considered spiritually powerful beings, with power to provide considerable good or to inflict harm, ibeji figures are the focus of great personal interaction and care. Such figures are considered a point of access to the spirit of a departed twin, and an icon of status for a mother of twins. Worn on the heads of male dancers, ci-wara headdresses are danced in male and female pairs to symbolize the fertility of land and animals. Each headdress represents an antelope, which for the Bamana is a metaphor for the successful farmer who tirelessly tills his fields.
 The V-form is a recurring motif in O’Keeffe’s art and in her wardrobe. In this painting, she has pushed the composition in the direction of abstraction by cropping the tree forms abruptly at the canvas’s edge, bringing focus to the V formed by the converging tree trunks. This V, painted in New Mexico a few months after Stieglitz’s death, may also be endowed with personal meaning. The two sets of bare tree trunks, rooted to each other in the ground but grown apart, may be a subtle reference to her partnership with Stieglitz, frayed by the end of his life because of his attentions to another woman.This painting can be seen hanging in O’Keeffe’s Ghost Ranch studio in the 1948 short film by Henwar Rodakiewicz, Land of Enchantment: Southwest U.S.A, on view nearby.
 Aerodynamic streamlining is characteristic of much American industrial and domestic design of the late 1920s and 1930s. Undecorated, curved designs, as seen here, are well suited to machine production and expressive of speed and change. The vanity and stool are made of chromed metal tubing, an innovation in furniture construction pioneered in the early 1920s by Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus, the seminal German school for modern design. It was still a startling new material a decade later. Although the vanity is gender-specific, this stark, modern interpretation has a limited palette and is made of new materials with hard surfaces. Updating an old form, Kem Weber transformed it for the modern woman.
 
 
 Although Pyrex glass, able to resist high levels of heat, had been invented as long ago as 1915, the Silver Streak iron put it to a new use. Metal shortages during World War II led to experiments not only with new materials, but also with new uses of old materials. Pyrex seemed the perfect replacement for metal in a household iron. Moreover, moldable glass allowed the handle of the Silver Streak to conform to the user’s hand, illustrating again the interest in ergonomics—the study of the way things work with the body—among designers of this time. Unfortunately, although Pyrex stood up well to heat, the bright colors inside did not, and the Silver Streak was not produced for very long.
 One of the leading figures of American Scene painting, Thomas Hart Benton traveled throughout the United States seeking what he perceived to be authentically American subject matter. After watching a rodeo in Wyoming, he made this watercolor, which provided the basis for a vignette in The Arts of Life in America, a monumental mural cycle installed at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1932. In the watercolor, Benton’s undulating lines and loose brushstrokes convey the energetic struggle between the horses and cowboys.
 From 1937 until his death, Marsden Hartley painted annually in his native state of Maine, returning each year to a landscape that he described as "strong, simple, stately" and "brutal." He adopted a boldly expressionistic, deliberately "primitive" style to convey his powerful response to this rugged, forbidding landscape. In Ghosts of the Forest, random piles of driftwood, bleached into pale, spectral shapes by exposure to the elements, dominate the foreground.
 Body Language The bold, open pose of the woman in Evening indicates that she is actively encouraging her partner’s attention. In contrast, the confidence man, or con man, in the adjacent painting stands aggressively near his female companion. His almost threatening stance and her downcast face suggest that he is not to be trusted. Despite the physical closeness of these two sets of figures, their faces are inscrutable and the nature of their interactions remains ambiguous. Guy Pène du Bois frequently painted stiff figures with masklike faces, suggesting social alienation beneath the glitter and gloss of the party scene.
 The modish hairstyle, form-fitting dress, and brazenly casual pose help to identify this sitter as a flapper—the name given to liberated young American women during the Roaring Twenties. Guy Pène du Bois is said to have found his inspiration for this painting in the work of another chronicler of the era, F. Scott Fitzgerald. The writer’s 1922 short story “Gretchen’s Forty Winks” featured the character Gretchen Halsey, “a bright-colored, Titian-haired girl, vivid as a French rag doll.”
 Tobacco was imported from Japan in exchange for marine products and furs. Among other imported goods were rice wine (sake) and rice.
 This depiction of a woman's head framed against a window is an example of Alfred Henry Maurer's late style--a striking, abstract mixture of linear and painterly elements. Late in his career, in poor health and emotionally drained because of negative reviews of his work, Maurer returned to this subject frequently, as if trying to solve the persistent aesthetic problem in his art: the balance between figuration and abstraction.
 In 1912 Stanton MacDonald-Wright and his colleague Morgan Russell invented the term Synchromy to refer to their experiments in making abstract compositions whose primary emphasis was on color. Although both artists were inspired by Cubism, they set out to reassert the importance of color in relationship to line in the creation of form.
 The rows of little hills under the Ram’s Head at Ghost Ranch must have been formed by thousands of years of wind and rain.… I had looked out on the hills for weeks and painted them again and again—had climbed and ridden over them—so beautifully soft, so difficult.… I had painted those hills from the car in bright sunlight and had failed dismally but I could see them—farther away—from my window in the rain. So I tried again. They seemed right with the Ram’s Head.… I don’t remember where I picked up the head—or the hollyhock. Flowers were planted among the vegetables in the garden between the house and the hills and I probably picked the hollyhock one day as I walked past. My paintings sometimes grow by pieces from what is around.—Georgia O’Keeffe, 1976In the mid-1930s, O’Keeffe’s frame maker George Of made scalloped and punched sheet metal frames for some of her paintings. These were inspired by vernacular traditions in tin ware made by Hispanic artists and artisans in the Southwest.
 In White Cod, the American modernist Marsden Hartley transformed the traditional allegorical function of still life as a memento mori, a reminder that all living things must die, into a deeply personal memorial. The two dead cod most likely allude to the 1936 drowning of Alton and Donald Mason, sons of a Nova Scotia fishing family with whom he lived during the summers of 1935 and 1936. Hartley linked the deaths of his beloved friends to Christ’s martyrdom through the traditional Christian symbolism of the fish. His expressive brushwork and somber palette also enhance the emotional intensity of this painting.
 The months that Hartley spent in Corea, Maine, in 1942 were exceptionally prolific because he was vigorously preparing for a one-person exhibition organized by his new dealer, Paul Rosenberg. Many of the paintings he executed were vibrant floral still lifes such as this one, most likely created with the expectation that they would be especially marketable.
 Here, Yasuo Kuniyoshi takes on a subject typical of his later career: still lifes. He named the pitcher depicted in this painting Juanita after purchasing it in Mexico on his honeymoon. Born in Japan, Kuniyoshi moved to California as a teenager. After studying in Los Angeles, he settled in New York. There, he was influenced by European modernist styles that his artist friends were exploring and by Japanese design and iconography, seen here in the monochromatic and flattened composition. Though labeled an “enemy alien” after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Kuniyoshi remained pro-American and even designed posters for the Office of War Information.
 Near the end of his life, after spending much of his career in New York, Marsden Hartley attempted to restyle himself as a painter from Maine. He used gulls, crabs, and lobsters in his work as icons of his New England roots. A poet as well as a painter, Hartley was inspired by the tenacity of the people and the ruggedness of the landscape. He belonged to the photographer Alfred Stieglitz’s circle of artists, who sought to create modern art that was spiritually rooted to the American soil.
 Vivid color and the lively interaction of abstracted forms convey a raucous mood in this small landscape. The work was created during a transitional period in Stuart Davis's art when he turned from a relatively restrained Cubist aesthetic to one more closely aligned with decorative impulses. The clay pipe, gas station, and barber pole reprise the principal elements of his 1932 mural for the Radio City Music Hall Men's Lounge at Rockefeller Center, originally entitled Men without Women. Here, however, the symbols of masculine activity register with a colorful vitality that fulfills Davis's aims for an art that was truly American in its outlook.
 Max Weber was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Bialystok, in modern Poland. In 1891 the Webers immigrated to Brooklyn, where Max studied art at the Pratt Institute. Between 1905 and 1908, he was in Paris, where he became one of the first Americans to fully absorb Cubism. The Visit is a Cubist domestic scene, probably depicting a courtship or a Shabbat (Sabbath) gathering—the men’s clothing and hats are typical of Jewish Orthodox dress. Weber began painting nostalgic scenes of Jewish domestic life in 1918, possibly in response to the pogroms that were then decimating entire Jewish populations in his native eastern Europe.
 Maya women in Guatemala wear traditional blouses, or huipil, as emblems of their ethnic and community identity. The multicolored geometric designs brocaded on the front, back, and shoulders of this huipil identify it as Quiche Maya from Chichicastenango. An abstract double-headed eagle motif appears on the front and back center panels as well as on the shoulders. Black silk appliqués decorate the sunburst design and four disks around the neck opening, representing the four cardinal directions.In agricultural societies such as the Maya, clothing designs relate to the natural world and have the power to protect the wearer from supernatural harm. When opened and laid flat, the huipil design has cosmological significance: the head opening becomes the sun, surrounded by the four directions and other designs inspired by the natural world. The wearer is therefore placed at the center of the universe.
 The Chemex coffeemaker was designed to be easy to grasp, like a chemistry beaker. The form of the human hand itself thus dictated its shape, at least insofar as the central hand-hold was concerned. The evocation of the “hourglass” female shape was probably incidental.
 Like the modernist John Marin before him, Milton Avery described landscapes in a spare and summary way, using a variety of precisely placed touches to suggest the key details of a place. In this view of the rolling coastline of Canada’s rugged Gaspé Peninsula, parallel charcoal lines and strokes of blue wash together indicate the trees on a hillside. Unlike Marin (whose work is also on view here), however, Avery always anchored his shorthand details within an overall composition, based in a few simple outlines and extending to the edges of the sheet.
 During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Japan exported large quantities of all types of objects, at a range of prices, to the West. Fashionable consumers purchased and displayed these objects in their homes. An item such as this fine album would have been prized not only for its exotic beauty but also for its sensitivity to the natural world, evident in the closely observed pictures of birds, insects, and plants.
 These sleek modernist versions of Pegasus, the flying horse of classical mythology, once flanked the entrances to the New York City Fire Service Pumping Station that still stands on Neptune Avenue between West Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Streets. The station boosted water pressure for fire fighting in outlying areas of Brooklyn. These four pairs of winged horses arise from stylized curving forms that suggest waves or clouds. Their compact double profiles reflect the Art Deco style of the industrial building whose entrances they once adorned. The streamlined design style was widely used in the 1920s and 1930s.

 A founding member of the Abstract Expressionist group known as the New York School, Richard Pousette-Dart began producing large, actively painted compositions of mystically symbolic shapes in the 1940s. Inspired by Native American, African, and Oceanic art, as well as the philosophy of Carl Jung, he strived toward a universal formal language through which to convey transcendent spiritual truths. His finest canvases are complexly constructed and have the effect of emitting light. The artist wrote in 1957, “A work of art for me is a window . . . or a doorway to every other human being. It is my contact and union with the universe.”
 To honor deceased family members, villagers kept carved wooden figures to contain the souls of their ancestors in the family house. These two female figures (adu bihara) holding small bowls are a type of image that was often tied together in a row to suggest a lineage of ancestors.

 Widely known by the 1930s as a muralist and political activist, Diego Rivera often undertook subjects rooted in indigenous Mexican traditions and folklore. This painting of bizarre tree forms set against a rocky hillside takes its name from the Spanish word for copal (nahuatl, in Aztec), the aromatic tree resin employed for centuries in Mesoamerica as incense. Copal was considered the “blood” of trees, and thereby suitable as food for the gods in the form of incense. The substance had artistic significance as well, as a binder for pigments employed in ancient mural painting.
 Figural realism was the dominant mode in American painting throughout the 1930s, when many artists strove to respond directly to the urgent, and often dire, social issues of the day. The Woodstock colony artist Alexander Brook was something of an exception in his preference for “studio pictures” of the sort that had been more current in the twenties, and in which a model’s physical presence was the primary subject. In Bacchante, the placement of the model’s hand enhances the masklike quality of the face and creates an arresting mood.
 Albert Swinden’s abstractions have been referred to as “calmly classical visions.” These words provide an apt description for this mural specifically, with its carefully balanced, disciplined composition of rectangular shapes punctuated by occasional biomorphic forms. Swinden seldom wrote about his art, but his brief essay “On Simplification,” published in the 1938 American Abstract Artists Yearbook, provides a succinct comment on the aesthetic concerns embodied in this mural. “We are moved not only by particular, or individual forms,” he wrote, “but by the relationships between the particular forms and their significance as a unity.”Swinden’s Williamsburg mural does not conform to his original conception for it. The changes he made (such as the addition of a black horizontal strip of canvas at the top and a wide, broken band of blue on the right) were probably in response to the demands of the specific space in which the mural was installed at the Williamsburg Housing Project. Similarly, the two inserts of unpainted canvas in the upper right and left corners represent areas occupied by structural beams at the mural’s original Williamsburg site. Swinden was born in Birmingham, England, and lived in Canada from the age of seven until his immigration to the United States in 1919. After studying at The Art Institute of Chicago for about eighteen months, he settled in New York City. There he enrolled in art classes at the National Academy of Design but soon decided to attend the Art Students League instead, where he studied from 1930 to 1934 and began to teach in 1932. He also studied for a time with the influential artist Hans Hofmann.Despite his association with, and position of respect among, some of the most progressive artists of his day, Swinden was unsuccessful in promoting his art in the commercial sphere. Although he was instrumental in founding the American Abstract Artists, was selected by Burgoyne Diller to execute important murals for the Williamsburg Housing Project and the 1939 World’s Fair, and was included in many group exhibitions in the 1940s, he often supported himself working as a textile designer or an engineering draftsman. Even though Swinden painted steadily throughout his life, his oeuvre is comparatively small. In addition, most of his early paintings were destroyed in 1940 in a fire at the studio he shared with Balcomb Greene (whose Williamsburg mural is also on view nearby). These facts increase the historical and aesthetic significance of Swinden’s “rediscovered” Williamsburg mural, for it now stands as a rare, and possibly the most important, surviving example of his early work.
 Paul Kelpe’s Williamsburg murals, like those of Bolotowsky, Greene, and Swinden, were conceived as entirely nonobjective compositions. However, they reveal a distinctly different approach to abstraction. Kelpe is unique among these artists for his strikingly unusual color combinations, his decorative patterning of selected fields of color, and his sculpturesque forms suggesting axial rotation.Kelpe was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists and participated actively in the organization as an exhibitor and an officeholder. Despite the stance of unity among the organization’s members in their desire to promote the acceptance of abstraction, Kelpe’s work provoked considerable criticism from within the group. His critics, most of whom favored the gridded geometries inspired by Mondrian, deplored his persistence in maintaining an illusionistic, three-dimensional space in which his abstract geometric solids float. Kelpe was thoroughly familiar with the European avant-garde. Born in Minden, Germany, he studied art history and architecture in Hanover, where he gained firsthand knowledge of the work of Kurt Schwitters, Wassily Kandinsky, and the Russian Constructivists, among others. After immigrating to the United States in 1925, he settled in Chicago in 1931. When he applied to the Chicago Regional Mural Division of the Federal Art Project, his application was denied because his bold abstract imagery did not correspond with the realistically rendered portrayals of American life that the Chicago office preferred. This rejection spurred him to move to New York City, where his abstractions found a more favorable response from Burgoyne Diller, who hired him to participate in the New York City Works Progress Administration Mural Program at Williamsburg.Although Kelpe continued to paint and exhibit frequently, he also pursued more academic aspects of art and earned a master’s degree and a doctorate in art history from the University of Chicago in 1948 and 1957, respectively. After teaching art history at the university level for many years, he retired in 1969 to devote himself to painting.
 The cool austerity revealed in Balcomb Greene’s mural displayed here provides a visual equivalent to the intellectual concerns he articulated in many essays and lectures throughout his career. Born in Milville, New York, and raised in the Midwest, Greene earned a B.A. in philosophy from Syracuse University in 1926. His introduction to the art world was through the young artist Gertrude Glass, whom he met in 1926 and married shortly thereafter. Greene went on for graduate study in psychology in Vienna in 1927. On returning to the United States, he shifted his focus to English literature, studying at Columbia University and then teaching at Dartmouth College from 1928 to 1931. Thereafter, the Greenes went to Paris, where Gertrude pursued her own career and Balcomb continued to write—poetry and fiction—and also became more deeply engaged with contemporary art. In Paris both Balcomb and Gertrude Greene found aesthetic affinity with the ideas of the Abstraction-Creation group, which emphasized pure plastic (or formal) elements such as line, color, and shape, and rejected anecdotal or natural elements and identifiablesubject matter.Greene’s relatively sudden embrace of painting met with early success, and he had his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1931. The Greenes returned to New York in 1932. Although Balcomb continued to write, his attention was increasingly drawn to painting. As a founder and the first chairman of the American Abstract Artists, Greene was an important force in promoting the group’s beliefs both in his paintings and in print.In the late 1930s Greene worked for the Mural Division of the WPA/FAP, executing this Williamsburg mural and another important one for the Federal Hall of Medicine at the 1939 World’s Fair. He also earned a master’s degree in art history at New York University in 1941.From 1942 to 1959 Greene taught art history and aesthetics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. Although he continued to paint and exhibit actively, he was no longer affiliated with any particular artists’ group or communal aesthetic or sociopolitical efforts. His work of the 1930s underscored his belief that art should be impersonal—as shown here in the cool remoteness of this mural—yet he turned in the early 1940s to an abstract idiom that relied on identifiable objects, a manner that he explored in his late paintings created in the Long Island studio that became his base in 1959.
 Of the four artists represented here, Ilya Bolotowsky achieved the greatest and most sustained measure of recognition. An intellectually and physically energetic man, he had wideranging interests that encompassed writing short stories and plays, collecting Eskimo and other North American Indian art, and making his own documentary and experimental films. Bolotowsky was primarily a painter, however, and was among the first of his generation to paint abstractions.Bolotowsky was born in Petrograd, Russia, to staunchly anti-Communist parents who later fled the country for political reasons. After some years in Constantinople, where he attended St. Joseph’s College from 1921 to 1923, his family finally settled in New York in 1923. From 1924 to 1930 Bolotowsky studied at the National Academy of Design, where he was trained to work in a figurative manner. In 1933, however, he saw paintings by Piet Mondrian and Joan Miró and was moved by their example to experiment in an entirely nonfigurative mode. As demonstrated in his Williamsburg mural displayed here, he had, by 1936, fully embraced an idiom that testifies to his admiration for Miró in both its lively interaction of hard-edged geometric and biomorphic shapes and its use of bright, unmodeled areas of color. The issue of pictorial space versus flatness was central to discussions among the members of the American Abstract Artists, in which Bolotowsky figured prominently. This mural may be seen to incorporate the two opposing approaches; some of his shapes seem to cavort in a vaguely illusionistic space, while others appear to be solidly anchored on the painting’s surface, emphasizing the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.By the 1940s Bolotowsky had devoted himself to the strict Neoplasticism of Mondrian. He continued to create his own variations on geometric abstraction for the rest of his career.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 With the introduction of the famous Fereghan horses from Central Asia, the course of Chinese history shifted significantly. Warfare, pageantry, and trade were affected by this development, as was Chinese art.The realistic modeling of these two sixth-century horses represents a long tradition of the equine form in funerary sculpture. The dynamic movement portrayed by the figure's turned torso is a new element of the era. Saddles became important decorative objects themselves in later periods.
 In this painting on paper, biomorphic shapes spread across the picture, changing form and moving in space. As with the Surrealists who practiced automatism, Gorky’s imagery revealed itself only in the process of creation, as pictorial ideas gradually emerged from the subconscious depths of the mind.Yet on another level, it is interesting to note that Gorky volunteered to serve in the camouflage section of the U.S. Army (though he was rejected on grounds of age). And he organized a class in camouflage painting, at the Grand Central School of Art in New York, because, as he wrote, such work would help the artist “deepen and enrich his understanding of art as well as make him an important contributor to civilian and military defense.” Beyond the self-absorbed practices of the Surrealists, therefore, he felt that art could also play a role in the war effort.This particular work has been compared to Picasso’s Guernica, painted a few years earlier, which Gorky is known to have admired. Both are intensely personal responses to the violence of war.
 With music playing at night and rooftop dancing, Childs Restaurant was one of many establishments at Coney that offered moderately priced food for people of average means. It opened on the boardwalk in 1923 at the time that many establishments had to move from Surf Avenue so that the main street and the Bowery could be widened to facilitate fire-extinguishing efforts. Clad in polychrome terracotta and inventively decorated with maritime themes, the shell of Childs Restaurant remains on the boardwalk today. It was designated a New York City landmark in 2003.
 Variations of the Tunnels of Love were among the early rides in the amusement parks at Coney. Like many other rides, they encouraged informal contact between men and women and provided new opportunities for interaction between young people. When these rides were introduced at the turn of the twentieth century, social etiquette often still made relaxed communication difficult.
 The 1920s was a prosperous period for Coney Island. This is a view of the boardwalk looking east from one of the new landmarks of this time: the large Half Moon Hotel with magnificent ocean views. Visitors to the boardwalk could rent wicker rolling chairs for a leisurely ride along the beach. In the 1940s, the hotel was turned into a maternity hospital.
 A boli is an abstract figure kept in a shrine belonging to a secret Bamana men's association. It is believed to be the embodiment of the spiritual powers of the society. These powers underlie the ability of the association to maintain social control. Today, the Kono society has lost its influence in most Bamana communities due to the conversion of Bamana to Islam.The basic form of this boli resembles a highly simplified cow. It is composed of a wooden core over-modeled with materials such as mud, eggs, chewed kola nuts, sacrificial blood, urine, honey, beer, vegetable fiber, and cow dung. The use of blood, excrement, and urine reflects the belief that these organic substances possess extremely potent spiritual powers.
 
 This informal portrait of Muzaffar al-Din Shah (r. 1896–1907) has been attributed to ‘Abdallah Qajar, who served as a court photographer to Nasir al-Din Shah. He later headed the photography department at the Dar al-funun, a European-inspired institution of higher learning where artists learned how to produce portraits in various media and traditions. ‘Abdallah Qajar also owned a commercial studio next to the Dar al-funun, which suggests that there was a market for photography outside of the court. The artist’s repertoire consists mostly of landscapes and portraits of high-ranking officials and royal family members. Here, Muzaffar al-Din Shah’s informal attire is emphasized by a couple of unbuttoned buttons on his overcoat.
Becoming AnotherThe play associated with masquerade can lead to the invention of new types of identities and new hybrid, not-quite-human masked beings. Moments of passage—into or out of this world, through birth or death, or from childhood to adulthood—bring with them the potential for disorder. Masquerade can offer a vision of transcendence, suggesting that such concerns belong to a world beyond limited human understanding. By transforming its participants into nonhuman beings, masquerade performance transcends everyday human reality and reminds all involved that their immediate concerns are governed by forces larger than themselves.Both of these masks by Mossi artists portray a being that combines human and animal characteristics. The tall, plank-like mask suggests a human-antelope hybrid, while the horizontal mask has both antelope and birdlike features.Most Mossi masks symbolically depict totemic animals associated with particular clans. Each family has an animal with which it has mythological connections and which protects it from harm. Such masks would appear at the funerals of important family members, a moment loaded with personal, community, and spiritual significance. At the end of their own active lives, masks might go on to second lives as altars, providing connection to the spirits of commemorated ancestors.
 The Dancer brooch and earrings were inspired by a photograph by Barbara Morgan of the dancer Martha Graham performing in Letters to the World in 1941. A free-flowing silhouette, the brooch was cut from a sheet of silver. Wiener said of this piece, “Even in doing literal translations, it was important to move into abstraction and evolve a secondary level of recognition.”

 Attributing a specific piece of ritual African art to a particular artist is seldom possible, in part because the artists often perpetuated the myth that the objects were not the work of human beings, and also because the original collectors of these pieces rarely inquired about the artists' names. This piece, however, has been attributed to Areogun of Osi, one of the most prominent Yoruba artists of the twentieth century. His distinctive style is identifiable in the figure's elaborate openwork headdress, proportionally large ears, and curved breasts.Kneeling female figures, often nude, are common in Yoruba religious art. In this pose, the figure represents a supplicant before the orisha, or deity, on whose altar it is placed. The image beautifies the altar and thereby honors orisha.
 Norman Rockwell’s naturalistic style, charming characterizations, and easily legible narratives of small-town life made him America’s most beloved illustrator. While his images are generally perceived as straightforward reflections of American life, they frequently demonstrate greater complexity. The Tattoo Artist, for example, subtly alludes to contemporary aesthetics—in particular, modernism’s interest in decorative patterns and the flatness of the picture plane—by suspending the figures in front of a wallpaper-like background of tattoo designs.
 Becoming AgainMasquerade is a moment for play—a chance to invent and experiment, even within established social needs and existing mask genres. These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.The two Bobo works share a basic form—a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns—typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.The Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.
 Body Language The bold, open pose of the woman in Evening indicates that she is actively encouraging her partner’s attention. In contrast, the confidence man, or con man, in the adjacent painting stands aggressively near his female companion. His almost threatening stance and her downcast face suggest that he is not to be trusted. Despite the physical closeness of these two sets of figures, their faces are inscrutable and the nature of their interactions remains ambiguous. Guy Pène du Bois frequently painted stiff figures with masklike faces, suggesting social alienation beneath the glitter and gloss of the party scene.
 This watercolor image is called a Kalighat painting, produced quickly and in multiples for sale in the markets around the Kali temple in Kolkata at the turn of the twentieth century. Common features of Kalighat paintings are the loose application of shading around the arms, legs, and faces of the figures and the rudimentary curtain at the top to suggest a stage or altar setting. Indian modernist artists of the early twentieth century would cite Kalighat paintings as a source of inspiration, noting that their Indian predecessors were abstracting the human form even before European painters.
 Boris Grigoriev trained in art academies in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Paris before finding inspiration in Russian cabarets on the eve of the October Revolution. He immigrated permanently to France in 1921 and continued producing his psychological portraits of Russian showgirls, artists, monks, and peasants. In Old Trombola Grigoriev heightens his sitter’s emotional state by emphasizing his intense gaze and exaggerating the sculptural qualities of his weathered hands and face. Grigoriev later wrote, “I have been watching and studying the Russian people for many years ... and these paintings are the fruits of my observations.”
 The Spacelander is a marvel of postwar biomorphic design. Its curving lines and amoeba-like voids represent the mutation of the prewar streamlined style into a new expression based on organic, rather than machine-made, forms. Although the prototype—made for a 1946 exhibition of British industrial design—was a critical success, Benjamin Bowden failed in his attempts to have it manufactured. By the time it finally went into production in the United States in 1960, tastes had changed and the price of the bicycle—$89.50—was too high. It is believed that only about five hundred examples were ever sold, making it one of the rarest and most sought-after industrial designs of the mid-twentieth century. When new, this bicycle was bright red; the color has faded over time.
 The Ball wall clock, sometimes called the Atomic clock, has become an icon of mid-twentieth century American design. It was the star of a line commissioned by the Howard Miller Clock Company to update its collection for a new, postwar generation of consumers. The rods and spheres evoking the structure of the atom introduced a modern scientific note into home or office interiors.
 The DCM is one of the most important and influential chairs of the postwar period. Although its official name mundanely refers to its use and materials—dining chair, metal (base)—it is commonly known as the “Potato Chip” chair because of its crisp, curving shapes. Growing out of wartime efforts to create a splint that conformed to the contours of the leg, this chair too is “organic” because its function is to support, and mimic, the shape of the human body.
 Kees van Dongen made a splash in 1920s Paris chronicling the city’s high society. His winning formula, exemplified here, involved placing his sitters against a neutral backdrop and punctuating the composition with brilliant—even supernatural—color. For his portrait of W. S. Davenport, an American dentist living in Paris, van Dongen added blue-green highlights to the face and a bright red brushstroke to the lapel. That red accent depicts a red thread that indicates Davenport’s knighthood in the exclusive Legion of Honor, awarded for his pioneering of facial reconstruction surgery during World War I.
 Clarence Carter’s “portrait” of the Sommer Brothers Hardware Store in Portsmouth, Ohio, is a quaint example of the rise of American Scene painting in the 1920s. Artists associated with this trend focused on images of rural or small-town locales and often described them in a deliberately simplified form of realism related to American folk art, then rising in popularity. Carter here commemorated a thriving commercial block—well-known throughout southern Ohio—that would be damaged beyond salvage in the 1937 Ohio River flood.
 Hospitality is an important virtue in many African societies. Among the Dan, the woman with the greatest reputation for hospitality is known as a wunkerle. On public occasions, she carries a spoon known as a wunkermian as a staff of office.
 This prototype of a vessel for pouring baby oil exemplifies both the wit and the practicality of Eva Zeisel’s designs. What does it feel like and how does it work are two questions always on her mind. In this case, though simplified and abstract, the shape wittily evokes a rabbit. The body of the vessel is meant to be held in one hand (with the baby cradled in the other) while the hand squeezes the “ears” to open the spout at the mouth and pour. The object not only feels pleasant in the hand but also performs its function well.
 In the period between the world wars, American manufacturers often hired freelance industrial designers to enhance the images of their products. Electrolux hired Lurelle Guild to redesign their vacuum cleaner. He produced an iconic design that embodies the era's fascination with speed and efficiency and incorporated new materials such as rubber and chrome to make Electrolux appear more innovative. This design, with variations such as the substitution of wheels for the gliders, remained in production for over twenty years.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Figurative posts often support the verandas of distinguished places such as important shrines or the dwellings of kings, titled elders, and priests. Just as a post supports the house, the carved figures represent the individuals who support and uphold the leader in his office.

 An nkisi nkondi serves as a container for potent ingredients used in magic and medicine, and in judicial and healing contexts. To make an nkisi nkondi, a carver begins by sculpting a human or animal figure with a cavity in the abdomen; then a ritual expert completes the work by placing ingredients with supernatural powers on the object and in the cavity provided. He activates the figure by breathing into the cavity and immediately seals it off with a mirror. Nails and blades are driven into the figure, either to affirm an oath or to destroy an evil force. The figure’s pose suggests that it may once have been carrying a knife or spear.
 The vegetable-shaped salt and pepper shakers and the curvilinear flask are splendid examples of the Aesthetic Movement style, which appeared strikingly new and modern to consumers at the time. The form of the shakers was inspired by realistic Japanese metal objects with which Americans were just becoming familiar, and their maker used a newly invented process to patinate the silver to resemble weathered copper. The irregular, ergonomic contour and dense Southwestern landscape of the flask would have also seemed quite daring to the original purchaser. In contrast, the all-over, hard-edged design of the later flask evokes the emerging, dynamic skyscraper skyline of big cities, and the unadorned, pyramidal forms of the later salt and pepper shakers have a timeless quality. While all of these objects were progressive when made, only the later ones still speak the language of modern design.
 ART OF VIRTUEArt can express our most important values. For the youngest of students to the most senior of elders, art can provide a vision of the ideal world. This writing board is evidence and expression of devotion and discipline, and a connection to an international community connected by Arabic, the language of the Qur'an. In Sudan, students historically used wood writing boards to practice their Arabic calligraphy and to help them memorize Qur'anic verses. The text written on the front of this board is a verse from the Qur'an, sura 97, which addresses the night of the first revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammad. The Lega figure called sakimatwemtwe, or "the man with many heads," represents the qualities of equity, wisdom, and discernment that enable its owner to see all sides of an issue and have knowledge of all things going on around him. It would have been owned by a man who belonged to Kindi, the highest level of Bwami, a hierarchical organization through which Lega initiates advance from one state of knowledge to the next.
 This striking mask, with its grimacing mouth, bean-shaped eyes, and bulbous, hooked nose, was made in the northern part of New Caledonia. The thick, shiny patina is evidence of the piece's age and considerable use. The holes around the perimeter were used to affix the beard and wig of human hair, a hat, feathers, and other elements of the costume that completely draped to the knees the dancer who wore it. Little is known about the function of these masks, however, though it is usually said that they represent the spirits of ancestors returning to the village. They may have been associated with now-extinct secret men's associations or used in social control.
 The career of Bob Thompson, the noted African American artist, was cut short by his early death at the age of twenty-eight. Thompson was born near Louisville, Kentucky, and studied at the University of Louisville and at Boston University. In the early and mid-1960s, he traveled throughout Europe and experienced many Renaissance paintings and other artworks firsthand. He fused the vigor and vibrancy of Expressionism with themes from Old Master compositions and the vivid palette of Fauve painting to create the original visual vocabulary exemplified by The Judgment. Recalling such time-honored Old Master subjects as the Last Judgment and the Judgment of Paris, here a nude male trio sits before faceless winged female angels while two figures (at left) await judgment. The planar, flattened figures and compositional contours in a gesturally applied background are all equally emphasized.
 When Lois Mailou Jones painted Leigh Whipper, the latter was at the height of his career as a Broadway and Hollywood actor. Within months of sitting for this portrait, Whipper would be famous for his role as Crooks in the 1939 movie adaptation of John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. Whipper’s character—a handicapped stable hand ostracized because of his race—served to illuminate the movie’s Depressionera message that the American Dream’s promise of economic and social success was impossible.This portrait shows Whipper as if seated at a Paris café. Jones herself had recently returned from a sabbatical in France and was teaching at Howard University in Washington, D.C. There she came under the influence of the Harlem Renaissance intellectual Alain Locke. Her portrayal of a pensive Whipper answered Locke’s call for black artists to create ennobling portrayals of African Americans.
 Necklaces like this one were made by the Ainu people, who inhabited parts of Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands before those areas were claimed by Japanese and Russian settlers. Ainu women wore these necklaces on formal occasions, and the necklaces were also displayed inside houses, alongside other treasured items. The origin of the glass beads may have contributed to the value of these items, as they were often imported from the southern islands of Japan or other foreign sources, traveling through extensive trade routes that linked the Ainu to distant communities in Manchuria and Sakhalin, among others.
 Gilbert Rohde ran one of the most successful American design studios of the early twentieth century. In a series of clocks designed for Herman Miller Clock Company, he transformed the traditional timepiece into a contemporary idiom through stark geometry, sleek curves, and modern numerals. This clock was first exhibited at the 1933-34 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago.
 Based on a life study of a seated male bather swathed in a towel and reading a newspaper, Villon’s simultaneously geometric and organic painting blends hard- and softedged intersecting planes with the contours of a powerful, muscular body and its enveloping white drapery. Although this work developed out of an initial interest in the human form, the artist gave it a title that evokes the metaphysical realm of the intellect or the incorporeal—reflecting Villon’s own considered approach to painting.
 Josef Albers’s Homage to the Square series is a study of the illusionistic effects of color. Starting with the rigorous geometry of nested squares, Albers created these works by applying paint directly from the tube and spreading it onto the Masonite board with a palette knife. The juxtaposed slabs of color play off one another, as some squares seem to recede into space while others float into the foreground. Albers pursued this study of color and perception from 1950 until his death, producing nearly a thousand canvases in the series.
 Augustus Aaron Wilson, a retired lighthouse keeper, is best known for his duck decoys and other small carvings. When the Ringling Brothers circus came to town in 1931, he was inspired by Emyr, said to be the largest tiger in captivity, to carve these tigers from salvaged railroad ties and telephone poles that he kept in his barn. The smaller of these two works is thought to be the earlier attempt.

 Throughout his career, Gifford Reynolds Beal painted subjects that celebrated American leisure pursuits in the decades between the two World Wars. In keeping with the extraordinary popularity of public rodeos during the Depression era, here the artist took on the theme of rodeo roughriders. The dynamism of the scene, in which two men help a third off a bucking horse, is enhanced by Beal’s brushy application of paint and use of bold lines.
 One of the first nationally recognized African American artists, Jacob Lawrence came to maturity in Harlem in the 1930s—a dynamic milieu marked by the great cultural achievements of the Harlem Renaissance, yet also by racism and the Great Depression. Throughout his long career, Lawrence devoted himself to painting genre scenes of working-class black life and epic series about African American history. Displaying the abstracted design elements and vibrant colors that characterize Lawrence’s style, Funeral Sermon commemorates the death of his sister from tuberculosis in 1944. An expression of personal grief, this work also addresses larger social issues, including the importance of spirituality in the black community—notice how Lawrence unifies the congregation in the foreground through the repetition of geometric forms—and the overcrowded housing and inadequate health-care facilities in Harlem that led to disease and untimely death.
 This portrait bust of President Abraham Lincoln was derived from the full-length standing portrait completed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1887 for Chicago’s Lincoln Park. Saint-Gaudens based Lincoln’s likeness on plaster life casts of the president’s head. The sculptor was inspired by Lincoln’s landmark 1860 speech at Cooper Union in New York, in which the future president declared that the founders would have opposed the expansion of slavery into new American territories. In this speech Lincoln also made famous the phrase “Let us have faith that right makes might.”
 The ikupasuy is a sacred object used for prayer. The worshipper dips the sharper end into rice wine (sake) or millet beer, and then sprinkles drops of the liquor. The ikupasuy is believed to be a medium for sending a message to a spirit or god. Delicately carved in relief on plain wood, ikupasuy show numerous design variations. They were sometimes lacquered by neighboring Japanese.
 Although best known as a portraitist, the Brooklyn painter Benjamin Osro Eggleston also enjoyed sketching the interesting characters he encountered around the city—an activity that harks back to his early career as a newspaper illustrator. This assured drawing captures the forceful personality of an anonymous girl whose anxious yet determined expression suggests she is steeling herself for a confrontation, perhaps with other children trying to take her apple.
 Charles Sheeler saw the modern equivalent of the imposing religious architecture of the past in the expansive, streamlined masses of factory buildings and refineries. Incantation, whose very title sounds like a spiritual evocation, is a fragmentary view of a continuous-flow oil production plant. Here Sheeler reduced the architectural forms to a more two-dimensional design in which shadows play as weighty a role as the metal tanks and pipes. The lack of a human presence suggests the degree to which these vast plants had come to be viewed as nearly autonomous forces.
 Josef Albers had a lifelong interest in color’s meditative qualities. With the help of simple color combinations, he aimed to show that flat shapes on a two-dimensional surface can create an illusion of movement and depth. Albers believed that the introduction of a white line into one of the color fields affected the perception of the color on both sides of the line. He felt that experimentation with subtle colors—as in these two works—proved the power of the line and the efficacy of his theory.
 These large keystones of male heads wearing garlands of grapevines represent satyrs (mythological creatures that are part human and part animal) or, perhaps, Bacchus, the god of wine in classical mythology. Their lively visages once adorned the facade of the Park Lane Hotel at Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Streets in Manhattan. The fourteen-story building was demolished in 1966.

 In this dynamic work, part of Willem de Kooning’s Woman series, the image is neither fully abstract nor completely representational. Human body parts, though discernible, are obscured by rich and frenzied painterly lines. Facial features are the artist’s only concession to an identifiable figure. The masklike face, flattened forms, and almond-shaped eyes show the influence of Pablo Picasso, whose work fascinated de Kooning from an early age. Born in the Netherlands, de Kooning came to the United States in 1926 in pursuit of the American dream as a stowaway aboard a British freighter.
 “Letting people have your paintings is like letting them wear your clothes,” said Florine Stettheimer, who was intensely private about her art. Her typically quirky mix of fantasy and reality is present in Heat—a family portrait of her mother, herself, and her three sisters gathered to celebrate Mrs. Stettheimer’s birthday.
 For some, modernity resulted in an increasing feeling of alienation, as people began moving through spaces at a faster pace. Edward Hopper captured this transitory nature of modern life in paintings infused with a sense of isolation and estrangement. Completed at the height of Hopper’s career, this painting shows Macombs Dam Bridge, which connects Manhattan and the Bronx. There are no signs of life in the city. Instead, an eerie stillness pervades the scene, resulting in a disquieting mood.
 An American architect, teacher, and writer, William Spratling helped to revive the moribund silver trade in Taxco in the 1930s after the town’s mines closed in the preceding decade in the wake of the Mexican Revolution. Spratling’s designs for silver frequently melded modern design forms with pre-Columbian motifs from Aztec, Mayan, and Olmec sources.
 One of Germany’s leading Symbolists, Stuck frequently painted biblical or mythological subjects that addressed dark themes such as sin and death. Particularly interested in the narrative and details of the Crucifixion, Stuck devoted several canvases to this subject late in his career, during the difficult years of World War I. Calling on new scholarly theories regarding the Gospel accounts, Stuck departs from tradition and places Christ at eye level with the witnesses to his sufferings. The artist cleverly structures his composition, placing the viewer immediately to the left of the crucified thief in the foreground and to the right of the haloed Virgin Mary, thereby closing a solemn yet intimate circle. Stuck also chooses to show Christ with his feet side by side rather than overlapping—again, referencing nineteenth-century debates about the historical details of this method of execution.
 Active as an artist, writer, and critic, Louis Lozowick is best known for stunning lithographs, such as this one, depicting urban and industrial scenes in the crisp geometric style of Precisionism. When he immigrated to the United States as a teenager, he encountered the iconography of the modern Machine Age—skyscrapers, factories, bridges, railroads—that would fascinate him for the remainder of his career. In Tanks (No. 1), Lozowick creates a celebratory vision of a nocturnal industrial landscape with a monumental storage tank rising heroically through a lattice of pipes and scaffolding. The image also speaks to progress through the juxtaposition of an airplane and a team of horses. Mastery of the lithographic medium is evident in the velvety surfaces and subtle tonal gradations, while the simplification of forms and faceted planes reveal Lozowick's debt to Cubism, Russian Constructivism, and other avant-garde styles that he saw during his travels in Europe in the 1920s.
 Faith Ringgold completed this work at the beginning of her artistic career, prior to the development of her signature painted “story-quilts.” However, its stylized figuration, strong colors, and bold black outlines would come to characterize much of her later work. Here Ringgold portrays herself with a determined gaze and folded arms, in a gesture simultaneously gentle and guarded. The work makes reference to Pop art and the work of Pablo Picasso, as well as the political ferment of the early 1960s. In reflecting on this work and the political and artistic awakening she experienced during this period, Ringgold has said, “I was trying to find my voice, talking to myself through my art.”
 In Manhattan Mosaic, George Copeland Ault’s narrow view of urban rooftops transforms the buildings into an abstract mosaic of planes and angles. The play of overlapping shapes, the harmonious blend of brown tonalities, and the deep shadows created by strong light emphasize the rich visual geometries of the modern city. At the same time, the composition’s tightly enclosed rooftop space reveals only a small view of the sky in the distance, suggesting a feeling of claustrophobia and anxiety that some associated with urban life.
 Is this a painting, a sculpture, or both? Gertrude Greene is credited with having been the first American artist to create completely abstract wood reliefs such as this one. She was a founder (in 1936) of American Abstract Artists, an organization that promoted the work of American artists who felt that their art was overshadowed by their more famous European contemporaries.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 It is rare for decorative arts objects to evoke an artistic movement, but this armchair, formerly owned by J. J. P. Oud (Dutch, 1890–1963), another De Stijl architect, has become an icon of the style; it expresses De Stijl ideology through balanced application of color and the arrangement of geometric elements. De Stijl artists shunned historicism and naturalism and sought new, abstract forms to express the ideals of the future.
 The New York artist Leon Polk Smith grew up in Indian Territory, Oklahoma, with parents of partial Cherokee ancestry. He acknowledged that the bold colors and sense of movement in his work were probably influenced by Native American art. Here, red and black curves create an illusion of movement. The rounded canvas, or tondo, exhibits two near-colliding red disks, which seem to have moved across a black void and come to rest with their circumferences practically touching. Or is it the black void that has thrust itself between two stationary disks?
 A figure painter known from the 1930s on for his baldly satirical commentaries on human appetites and desires, Paul Cadmus was throughout a master draftsman. Although he undertook still-life subjects only rarely and, as he once stated, as “practice works like scales,” he achieved parity between figure and still life in Mobile. Here, a beautifully proportioned young man holds a mobile composed of beach detritus (wood, feathers, shells, and bones) in a delicate state of balance—a reference to the weightlessness of spent forms, and a meditation on mortality.
Morgan Russell temporarily abandoned his color abstractions--which he called Synchromies--to paint representational subjects with greater market appeal. In 1922, however, he returned to the Synchromistic aesthetic, which he found emotionally and creatively invigorating. Abstraction bears a strong formal relation to a series of paintings he called Eidos, a term taken from the Greek word meaning "form."  The illusion of spinning motion relates to Russell's plan to accompany his paintings with a kinetic light machine that would suggest the afterimage of fireworks. The signature along the horizontal is not in Russell's hand, and it is generally agreed that the painting should be oriented vertically.
 Even when inspired by a particular individual, representations of the human body can acquire universal meanings. Here, Standing Woman suggests an essential female force and vitality. Beginning in 1912, Gaston Lachaise began modeling standing figures inspired by his voluptuous American lover (and wife by 1917), Isabel Nagle.Indicative of its greater significance, Lachaise referred to his subject, in all its permutations, simply as “Woman.” Owing to its celebration of female physical abundance, critics attributed to this work and others like it a timelessness and a kinship with prehistoric representations of fertility.

The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design.

 This cast aluminum ventilation cover is one of several from the main lobby of the Loew’s Grand Theater in Atlanta. After purchasing the building (originally built in 1893 as DeGive’s Grand Opera House) in the early 1930s, the Loew’s theater chain renovated the theater in the most up-to-date fashion according to designs by architect Thomas W. Lamb, one of the leading designers of American movie palaces. In 1939 the theater gained national renown as the site of the premiere of the film Gone with the Wind. When the building burned in 1978, architectural elements such as this were salvaged and sold. The donor purchased this grille on the demolition site.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.

 In 1920 the subway was extended to Coney Island, making the trip even faster and cheaper than before. Up to one million visitors a day would come to enjoy the beaches and the amusement parks with higher and faster rides. The subway, like many of the rides in the amusement parks and the famous hot dogs at Nathan’s, cost five cents, a fact that contributed to the description of Coney as the Nickel Empire.
 The Coney Island beach was made public in 1915 after a long legal battle, and the boardwalk was finally constructed in 1923. Municipal baths replaced the private establishments, and the city added sand to fight erosion and create more beachfront. At this point the exclusive Seagate had long since separated from the main part of Coney, while the eastern end had gone out of fashion, with the last remaining resorts quickly disappearing. The Oriental Hotel closed in 1916, and Brighton Beach Hotel was razed a few years later. In the 1920s, many Eastern European Jews and Italian and Greek immigrants took up residence in the neighborhood adjoining the amusement district. Dreamland was long gone, and Luna somewhat declining, but Steeplechase was still a popular destination. In the background of this image, note the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel, the colorful Wonder Wheel from 1920 with its double ring of cars.
 Skyscrapers loom above older buildings, planes fly overhead, and people crowd the sidewalks in this dramatic bird’seye view of Manhattan’s Wall Street. Bertram Hartman’s meaning may not be quite so straightforward, however. He painted Trinity Church and Wall Street in the year of a great stock market crash that devastated the nation’s economy. By showing the gothic spires of Trinity Church overshadowed by skyscrapers, Hartman may have intended his viewers to contemplate the relationship between spiritual and material needs in modern life.
 The leading American modernist Arthur B. Davies had been exploring the theme of expressive modern dance in his paintings for about a decade when he completed this work. He addressed the effects of World War I, at least symbolically, with its title, which references the mounting casualties of the war. Inspired in part by the seminal modern dancer Isadora Duncan, Davies had often composed figure compositions suggestive of sequential movement and, therefore, of elapsed time and music. Here, the more rigid dramatic postures of the figures may have been modeled on the theatrical modern choreography of Ruth St. Denis.
 While Western collectors value the visual impact of power figures, the ultimate importance of these sculptures to the Songye lies in their effectiveness as protectors of the community from malevolent forces and disease. The power of such figures depends on their ingredients (bishimba), concealed in the abdominal cavity, in the top of the head, or in a horn set into the cranium (missing from this piece). These hidden substances acquire potency and interact with the spirit world when assembled by the nganga, or ritual practitioner.
 From 1920 to 1933, Prohibition, the United States government's vain attempt to ban alcoholic manufacturing and consumption, forced American to drink at home. This restriction led to a new social event, the cocktail party, and is accessories, the cocktail table and the cocktail shaker. This sleek cocktail set was made of a then-new material, chrome-plated metal, and the modern American icon, the skyscraper, inspired its design.

 With its combination of naturalistically painted flowers and Asian objects, this stunning watercolor recalls the still lifes of John La Farge, and demonstrates Western artists’ enduring fascination with art of the Far East into the twentieth century. Like La Farge, who was one of the earliest and most influential proponents of Japonisme in America, Anna Fisher sets up engaging contrasts between natural and artificial, ephemeral and enduring, and local and exotic.
 Korwar figures serve to keep surviving relatives in contact with their deceased ancestors and thus always able to secure their powerful blessings. They serve as a medium of communication between the living and the dead. Korwars may be standing or squatting figures. The heads are large in relation to the highly abstract bodies; the chin is usually straight, horizontal, and broad; and the nose is the most prominent facial feature. This highly unusual double figure holds a shield (now partially eroded). The shield has been said to derive from the snake, which in turn represents rejuvenation and regeneration, a key idea in the religion of the people of Cenderawasih Bay.
 Becoming ControlledBecause masks take on nonhuman, otherworldly characteristics, they are particularly effective as mediators of power. Despite their capacity for freedom and play, masks can also express social limits, serving as agents of calm in moments of tension or anxiety, or as frightening policers of the community on behalf of those in power.The Igbudu mask represents the evil forces that can threaten a community. One of the only examples of Yoruba sculptural art that is deliberately unattractive, it features a sharp brow, protruding eyes, and wide mouth—all designed to frighten.The commanding Loma mask, Okobuzogui, is used by the Poro society, a secret men’s association that serves, among other roles, to initiate boys into adulthood. Poro mythology holds that Okobuzogui “swallows” the boys in his menacing jaws as they leave the village for the initiation camp; he also accompanies them upon their return as young men.Tugunga headdresses are worn only by those who belong to a secret Bamum society of warriors, known as the Nsoro, who perform at the funerals of important members of the community. The masks impress with their size and grandeur and elicit fear and apprehension since they represent the society charged with adjudicating disputes and protecting the king.
 Already committed to a realistic style and to African American subjects, Eldzier Cortor was on his way to the Georgia Sea Islands when he was inspired to paint this image. A languid young couple is shown picnicking before the backdrop of a valley that has been flooded to construct a hydroelectric dam. Cortor endowed the muscular figures with a calm stoicism, modeling their facial features on the fixed and powerful forms of African masks. According to the artist, “[It] was created from my feelings in the face of devastation, and the two figures represent youth with hope.”
 This composition of dynamic forms is one of twelve works that George Lovett Kingsland Morris invested with references to Native American culture in an effort to create a distinctly American mode of abstraction, Morris was won over to abstraction during his stay in Paris from 1929 to 1930, when he studied with the avant-garde French artists Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant at the Académie de l'Art Moderne. Although Morris soon was among the most vigorous promoters of European-inspired abstract art in the United States, he encouraged artists to establish an original American vocabulary of forms by turning to indigenous arts for inspiration. Here the Native American references include the allusion to the texture of birch bark, the arcing, arrowlike form at the left, and the tooth- or clawlike forms in the lower register.
 Drawing played an integral preparatory role in the modernist sculpture of Chaim Gross, who used it to capture the poses of live models and to conceptualize his ideas for a work. This sheet served as a study for Ballerina (see illustration), featuring one of his favorite subjects—a female dancer or other performer. The drawing’s energetic hatch marks and looping scribbles anticipate the rough-hewn surface textures of the carved sculpture.
 The neighborhood around Wall Street has been the commercial center of New York City since colonial times. Before moving inside, brokers gathered outdoors to trade goods and stocks at various markets. The American Stock Exchange, one of many exchange places in the area, moved to an indoor space only in 1921. Until then, as Joseph Petrocelli captured in this iconic image, brokers challenged bad weather at the curbside market on Broad Street, shouting and gesticulating in order to communicate their transactions. At the time of Petrocelli’s photograph, recently built skyscrapers already towered high over the streets, dwarfing the New York Stock Exchange, the neoclassical building on the left side of the picture, and the Federal Hall National Memorial, on Wall Street, in the background.
 This figure’s protruding abdomen allowed room for the insertion of various medicines by an nganga (ritual specialist) to activate the spirit force reached through the figure. These ingredients were sealed in a cavity behind the tack at the navel. The figure’s oily surface is probably the result of rubbing with palm oil or fat obtained from crushed termite queens.
 Israel Litwak was born in Odessa, then part of Russia. He emigrated to the United States in 1903, settling in Brooklyn and working as a cabinetmaker. He began to paint after retiring at age sixty-eight. Litwak recorded the urban scene as well as place visited on vacations such as the subject shown here. Crawford Notch in the White Mountains of New Hampshire had often been celebrated by nineteenth-century, but Litwak's image is very much his own invention. "One achieves good painting by imagination, talent, patience and a lot of hard work," he wrote. "I look . . . just to get an idea; then I go home and make it the I want it, not the way it is."
 In 1944, Isamu Noguchi designed this low glass-topped table resting on organic-shaped walnut forms. To create it, he returned to the design of a unique object he had made in the late 1930s and revised it for manufacture by the Herman Miller company. Here, transparency is combined with balance, as the top is unfixed and the two support legs hinge at a single point.
 Grace Chapella’s designs are inspired by archaeological vessels from the ancient Hopi site of Sityakti, which dates from the fourteenth to the fifteenth century. The butterfly symbolizes man’s spiritual transformation. Mark Tahbo, an accomplished potter and Chapella’s great grandson, interprets the jar’s designs as symbolic of water’s life-giving cycle: the butterflies indicate a burst of life after the spring rains; the wave patterns dotted with cross forms are cornfields surrounded by water; the jagged peaks are the three Hopi mesas in northern Arizona; and the black fingerlike forms are prayer feathers used in rain ceremonies. Los diseños de Grace Chapella están inspirados en vasijas arqueológicas del antiguo sitio Hopi de Sityakti, el cual data del siglo catorce al siglo quince. La mariposa simboliza la transformación espiritual del hombre. Mark Tahbo, alfarero experto y nieto de Chapella, interpreta los diseños de la jarra como símbolos del ciclo del agua como fuente de vida: las mariposas indican una explosión de vida después de las lluvias de primavera; los diseños ondulados jaspeados con forma de cruz son campos de maíz rodeados por agua, los picos serrados son las tres mesas Hopi al norte de Arizona; y las formas negras que semejan dedos son plumas de oración usadas en ceremonias de lluvia.
 One can witness a wide variety of masquerades addressing issues of social well-being, protection, and health, as well as personal and spiritual concerns, in the Ogoni communities of southeastern Nigeria in which Zina Saro-Wiwa works.Elu masks, such as this one, are danced by young members of secret men’s societies that have social, religious, or governmental functions. The small masks are attached to cone-shaped caps of fiber and cloth that cover the heads of the dancers. They are usually danced at annual festivals or at funerals of members of the societies. As Saro-Wiwa notes, Elu is an older, and more delicate, form of Ogoni masquerade than the newer genre in which she has worked.
 Rockwell traveled to Boston with Saturday Evening Post art editor Ken Stuart to photograph fans during a doubleheader between the Boston Braves and the visiting Chicago Cubs at Braves Field. Additional images taken in the studio were used to fill out the jeering crowd. Rockwell himself can be found in the upper left corner of the painting. The artist typically used oil paints for his final work, but this is a rare example done in watercolor.
 Taken in 1940, these photographs capture women in Harlem who rejected the limitations of domesticity. In Street Scene 2, there is a clear assertiveness about the standing woman, with her left arm holding a stack of newspapers and her right hand on her hip. In Lady and Lamp, the subject’s reclining posture and distanced gaze are juxtaposed with her formal attire, suggesting the need to unwind after a long day of work. Like other New York City neighborhoods at the time, Harlem was still recovering from poverty, overcrowding, and other devastating symptoms of the Great Depression. Details in these photographs, such as the ripped fabric on the arms of the chair and the “Furnished Room” si, hint gently at the harsh conditions that these modern urban women were up against.
 This work is the final design for a twenty-six- foot mural for the Nabrit Science Hall at Texas Southern University. John Biggers described its subject as “the interdependence of living organisms in the balance of nature, and the relationship of all organisms to one another through the long line of evolutionary descent.” Biggers centered the image on an essential earth mother. Throughout, he paired oppositional references to life and death (winter and summer), male and female (the two nudes), and Africa and America (in vignettes of harvest and sowing). A leading twentieth-century African American painter and muralist, Biggers drew inspiration from the Mexican Mural Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s. He also infused the composition with the kind of organic, cellular design that was so current in midcentury American art.
 This personal shrine reflects the great value the Igbo place on individual achievement. Personal shrines are created in the form of figures known as ikenga to honor the power and skills of a person's right hand, as the right hand holds the hoe, the sword, and the tools of craftsmanship. The basic form of an ikenga is a human figure with horns symbolizing power, sometimes reduced to only a head with horns on a base.
 Because of its low cost and easy care, plastic attracted both consumer and designer in the postwar era. Russel Wright worked with the chemical company American Cyanamid to develop a line of dinnerware from its patented plastic, Melamine. Although that venture was not successful, Wright soon found other companies to produce his designs for plastic dinnerware. Originally intended for institutional use, plastic dinnerware also found a place at home, and by 1957 Wright’s Residential line, produced by Northern Industrial Chemical, had door-to-door sales of $4 million.
 The undulating lines of the wooden bowl shown here evoke a jellyfish in motion, or a leaf curling in the summer sun. Russel Wright experimented with these curving, biomorphic shapes in several media and clearly found them interesting in their own right. Although neither easy to make nor particularly suited to their purpose, these bowls were, however, wonderfully playful and suggestive of nature to the consumers he targeted.
 The small pangolin (a mammal with a scaly hide that protects itself by coiling into a ball) is worn by the members of Bwami’s Ngandu and Yananio grades. When associated with hats, the pangolin symbolizes piety and respect.
 This hat would only have been worn by initiates to Kindi, the highest level of Bwami. Tail hair of an elephant, a metaphor for Kindi, crowns the hat. European-made buttons began to replace cowrie shells as prestige items on such Bwami paraphernalia as the Western presence grew in eastern Congo in the early twentieth century.
 Growing up on the urban terrain of concrete sidewalks, Brooklyn children and teenagers have long embraced skating as a pastime. In 1950 N. Jay Jaffee photographed a young skater as she extended her arm out to gain balance independent of her father’s hold. Vincent Cianni’s 1995 image captures a graceful moment of a teenage boy midair. The backgrounds of these images reveal changing textures of the neighborhood landscapes: felt hats with fur trim and arched glass storefront windows in the former, and baggy T-shirts and graffiti scrawled along a block in the latter. Although taken forty-five years apart, these photographs display skating as a communal and enjoyed act for Brooklyn youth.
 In the past, this child’s rocking horse was often attributed to the influential American architect Philip Johnson. However, recent scholarship has revealed this to be a half-truth. In fact, it was the idea of another Philip Johnson, artistic director of the toy company Creative Playthings. He suggested it to Gloria Caranica, a recent graduate of Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute he had just hired.
 This type of statue with multiple heads, called ginin, was commissioned by a group of individuals with a shared lineage, to be placed on an ancestral altar. It represents solidarity and the protection of the family, with one face looking in each of the cardinal directions from which danger might come.
 Dorr Bothwell’s Memory Machine recalls the Surrealist roots of much postwar art. In this eerie, dreamlike landscape, the central form suggests a futuristic television set, supplier and preserver of modern memories. Dorr (or Doris) Bothwell worked and taught in the San Francisco Bay Area, another urban center that was a focus of art production in the forties and fifties.
 The Biombo have been strongly influenced politically and culturally by their neighbors to the north, the Kuba. Like Kuba masks, Biombo masks are worn at funerals and initiations. Masks in both traditions have large slit eyes and painted geometric patterns on the forehead, cheeks and chin. The muted red color seen here is more characteristic of Biombo masks, however.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 Agbogho mmwo, or "maiden spirit," masks are worn by men at festivals that honor important deities. They represent the Igbo ideal of female beauty: small, balanced features, elaborate hairstyles, and delicate tattoos. The men who dance agbogho mmwo masks wear colorful, tight-fitting fiber costumes, entertaining the crowd with exaggerated versions of women's dances.
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”
 This group of plaques shows the steps in the process for making cloisonné. Technically, cloisonné employs the diverse skills of painting, engraving, metalworking, casting, and firing. To create designs on metal vessels, enclosures made of bronze or copper called cloisons (French for “partitions”) are bent to the desired pattern and either pasted or soldered onto the body. Enamels are essentially glass, colored with metal oxides, that is ground to a powder, mixed with water, and placed as a paste inside the cloisons. The vessel is then fired at a low heat between 1280 and 1328 degrees Fahrenheit. During firing, the enamel may shrink; after cooling, the process is repeated and re-fired until the cells are completely filled with fused enamel.
 Europe's name, and much of its culture and worldview, is rooted in the Greco-Roman classical tradition. In fact, the continent is named after the Phoenician princess Europa of Greek mythology, who was seduced by the god Zeus in the form of a white bull. In antiquity, "Europa" appeared on world maps to designate Europe, or all known land masses north of the Mediterranean. In this eroticized version of the myth of Europa and the bull, Carl Milles revived the ideal classical nude. Here, Europa dominates Zeus, clutching the bull’s curling tongue.
 Unlike the smooth, high glazes on contemporaneous pieces by Eva Zeisel and Russel Wright, the textured, organic surface of Ben Seibel’s teapot and celery dish recalls the green glazes used earlier in the century on Arts and Crafts wares. Raymor dinnerware, a pioneering line in the marketing of modernist design to Americans, enabled those with modest means to buy good design at affordable prices.
 Ted Hallman has been at the vanguard of modern textile design since the late 1950s, when he began to combine natural fibers with acrylic, a relatively new material at the time that had been developed for military use during World War II. The juxtaposition of natural fibrers with the luminous new synthetic material was wholly original at the time. A nearly identical hanging by Hallman was included in the seminal 1969 exhibition Objects USA, which introduced Americans to variety of new designs of the emerging craft movement and helped to bridge the perceived aesthetic gap between so-called craft and fine arts.

 This showgirl, with her direct, heavy-lidded gaze and rouged face, is an example of the “new woman” of the 1920s. Her stance, with turned-out leg and arms akimbo, imply the new and highly sexualized dances popular during the Roaring Twenties. John Carroll alludes to the lively, angular rhythms of popular jazz through the repeated and patterned form of the musician, whose face suggests the shape of an African mask—linking jazz to African culture.
 Gelede masks, such as this one, are worn by male Yoruba dancers at festivals honoring the women of the community, living and dead, especially the powerful Great Mothers, including both the elderly women of the community and the ancestors of Yoruba society. The gelede performances entertain and educate, and document elements of everyday life, such as the woman’s head tie in this example. Through their movements, gelede dancers express Yoruba ideals of male and female behavior.
 Born Joseph Ruiz, in Louisiana, José de Rivera was an important abstract sculptor of the mid-twentieth century. His career culminated with the commission for a large-scale outdoor sculpture for the Mall in Washington, D.C. As with Alexander Calder, the most famous Aamerican abstract sculptor of the last century, de Rivera seems to have made jewelry for most of career but never actively retailed it. This abstract, biomorphic brooch is made of stainless steel, his preferred material for his sculpture but a relatively unusual choice for American jewelry in the mid-twentieth century. The historical importance of the brooch is heightened by rare documentation. In 1947, de Rivera made two brooches for his sister-in-law Elva Ruiz, who was married to his half brother Gordon, and his niece Muriel. Iin a letter to Elva, de Rivera terms the pieces “sculpture brooches” and adds that “I hope that you will like the shapes and wear them—also that they will give you some pleasure.”
 Like many toys, doll’s houses teach children how to live and behave in the adult world. In offering up the entire domestic world at a glance, doll’s houses also reflect, in particular, how objects surround human lives and exert their influence on us.This doll’s house was designed by Gerrit Rietveld, one of the most important furniture designers, architects, and advocates of modernism in the early twentieth century. It was made for the children of the Jesse family, whom he was visiting at the time. Here, the children—Anita and Matcheld—could envision a pared-down lifestyle, surrounded by tasteful modern objects, in the postwar world.
 This peyote rattle was played during Native American Church ceremonies, which combine Native and Christian beliefs. Peyote is a hallucinogenic cactus that is ritually ingested in tea or dried form to induce visions, which are believed to help achieve more harmony with the universe. The gourd symbolizes the world, and the sound it makes represents prayers. The gourd’s zigzag decoration symbolizes Christ’s crown of thorns. The handle’s beaded lightning design, which signifies man’s ability to ascend from earth into heaven, is encircled by a red horsehair fringe that represents the rays of the sun at sunrise, the hour when Christ arose from the dead. The medal attached to the handle reads, “Behold the heart of Jesus is with me.”Esta maraca de peyote se tocaba durante ceremonias de la Iglesia Nativo Americana, en la que se combinan creencias nativas y cristianas. El peyote es un cactus alucinógeno que se ingiere ritualmente en forma de té o seco para inducir visiones, las cuales se cree que ayudan a alcanzar mayor armonía con el universo. La calabaza simboliza el mundo, y el sonido que produce representa a las plegarias. La decoración zigzagueante de la calabaza simboliza la corona de espinas de Cristo. El diseño relampagueante de las cuentas en el mango, el cual significa la habilidad el hombre para ascender desde la tierra al cielo, está rodeado por un borde rojo de crin de caballo que representa los rayos del sol al amanecer, la hora en que Cristo se levantó de entre los muertos. La medalla sujeta al mango dice, “Contemplad que el corazón de Jesús está conmigo.”
 The painter of this hanging scroll, best known for his landscapes, was a descendant of Qing dynasty (1644–1911) royalty. He received a privately tutored classical education that included training in painting and calligraphy, and he excelled at both. He began studying painting formally at the age of thirty, and as was the custom at the time, he learned by copying masterpieces in the royal collection.
 The vegetable-shaped salt and pepper shakers and the curvilinear flask are splendid examples of the Aesthetic Movement style, which appeared strikingly new and modern to consumers at the time. The form of the shakers was inspired by realistic Japanese metal objects with which Americans were just becoming familiar, and their maker used a newly invented process to patinate the silver to resemble weathered copper. The irregular, ergonomic contour and dense Southwestern landscape of the flask would have also seemed quite daring to the original purchaser. In contrast, the all-over, hard-edged design of the later flask evokes the emerging, dynamic skyscraper skyline of big cities, and the unadorned, pyramidal forms of the later salt and pepper shakers have a timeless quality. While all of these objects were progressive when made, only the later ones still speak the language of modern design.

 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer. Seedpod rattles and metal bells added a musical aspect to the performance.Although they are danced by Luvale men, mwana pwevo masks depict women. In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.
 Born in remote Roswell, New Mexico, Peter Hurd established his home at Sentinel Ranch, in nearby San Patricio, by 1940 and devoted himself to painting the area’s distinctive landscape. Hurd had been experimenting with the medium seen here—egg tempera (an egg-based, water-soluble paint mixture) applied to gesso-coated panels—since the early 1930s. Derived from Italian Renaissance practice, the method allowed him to achieve a brilliancy of color and “flatness” that he believed were otherwise attainable only with watercolors.
 This aerial photograph of the atomic bomb blast over the Japanese city of Nagasaki was taken on August 9, 1945, documenting the event that led to the end of the war in the Pacific only days later. Paradoxically, the mushroom cloud, so widely understood as an emblem of death and destruction, took the shape of a living form, seeming to resemble the stem and flattened cap of a common toadstool.
 In 1923 Ilya Bolotowsky immigrated with his family to New York from Saint Petersburg. By 1936 he had completed his training at the National Academy of Design, painted his first nonobjective work, and become a founding member of the American Abstract Artists group. Opalescent Vertical is a nearly monochromatic meditation on straight lines and pure forms inspired by the art of Piet Mondrian; abstractions like this one would have been denounced at the time in the Soviet Union, where the censors only recognized Socialist Realism as true Soviet art.
 At the age of seventy-one, May Wilson left rural Maryland and a decades-long marriage for New York City, where she took up residence at the Chelsea Hotel. Because she was generations older than the avant-garde artists she was drawn to, and being largely self-taught, Wilson acquired the nickname “Grandma Moses of the Underground.” In her Ridiculous Portraits, Wilson collaged ludicrous photo-booth self-portraits onto images she collected from picture postcards, reproductions of famous paintings, mainstream magazines, and soft-core pornography. Produced as personal mementos and often exchanged through the mail with other artists as gifts, her Ridiculous Portraits attacked sexism, ageism, and the cult of beauty with a wry sense of absurdity.
 Although little is known about this figure, its hairstyle, ridged in front and worked into small circles in back, and small scars carved across the brow and along the edge of the jaw indicate it is of Zande origin. Such decorative markings, either on art objects or living persons, are clues to group affiliation, rank, and status.
 Modernizing the Urban Landscape By the late 1920s, signs of modernization and industrialization were intruding on the residential neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights, where Isabel Lydia Whitney grew up. The Emerald Tower and The Blue Peter are part of a series of works Whitney painted about 1927 of the changing area. Exhibited in 1928, the series was praised for its honest depiction of the American scene and “the poignancy of transition.” In The Emerald Tower, the iconic Brooklyn Bridge is relegated to the far distance, and the painting is dominated instead by the new Squibb building, part of a manufacturing plant for a pharmaceutical company. The masts, smokestacks, and rigging seen in The Blue Peter hint at the encroachment of waterfront commerce.

 Chaim Soutine’s passion for painting led him from a Lithuanian Jewish ghetto in modern Belarus to the art academies of Minsk and, ultimately, Paris. In the French capital, he turned his back on the prevailing avant-garde style of Cubism and embraced the expressive manner of Rembrandt and Goya, whose works were then on view in the Louvre. In Still Life, Gladiolas Soutine brings together the expressive brushstrokes of the Old Masters with the brilliant color and flattened compositions of Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse.
 In a departure from the vivid hues of his sun-drenched scenes, Matisse focuses here on the muted earth tones of a light-dappled forest. He renders the angled trees in long brushstrokes in a range of browns, allowing the substantial trunks to taper and dematerialize in lightly sketched, ghostly passages at the top. By contrast, the painter creates a hint of sky by daubing a thick, lightly blended mix of blue and white over the branches and foliage. While using a vertically oriented canvas, Matisse provides a sense of spatial recession with a path punctuated by pools of light.
 This figure most likely embodies a "spirit spouse"—the husband or wife every person is said to have had before birth. Through dreams, misfortune, and other signs, a person may learn that his or her spirit spouse feels neglected or jealous. One way to appease the spirit is to commission a carved figure of it and carefully nurture it with food offering and perhaps bathe and rub it with oil.
 The ikupasuy is a sacred object used for prayer. The worshipper dips the sharper end into rice wine (sake) or millet beer, and then sprinkles drops of the liquor. The ikupasuy is believed to be a medium for sending a message to a spirit or god. Delicately carved in relief on plain wood, ikupasuy show numerous design variations. They were sometimes lacquered by neighboring Japanese.
 Max Weber painted this small canvas the year after his marriage, and some scholars have attributed the quiet, decorative sensibility of this and other of his works to the calming influence of domestic life. In this Cubist rendering of a cellist, the figure's closed eyes hint at the ecstasies of making music. The shadowy profile of a woman's head that helps to define the musician's torso and merges with the cello may rely on a traditional iconography in which the curved shapes of the instrument were metaphors for the female form.
 Manuel Alvarez Bravo grew up during the Mexican Revolution (1910−20), a formative period that strengthened his sense of kinship with his homeland. During this time he was introduced to the medium of photography, and he bought his first camera in 1924. Initially working in the Pictorialist tradition, Alvarez Bravo started to experiment with abstract compositions in the late 1920s. In 1927 he befriended the Italian photographer Tina Modotti, who had been living and working in Mexico since 1923, and he later took over her job as a staff photographer at the magazine Mexican Folkways. This post helped him cultivate his own vision, as he developed emblematic themes of Mexican identity blended with unconscious imagery reflecting dreams and chance. In this photograph, Alvarez Bravo uses the everyday to create a compelling vision of Mexico’s urban landscape. The horizontal expanse of wall centers the layered composition, separating the world above from the one below. Two figures, seemingly unaware of each other, pass on the empty street, while stark white laundry hangs in the domestic space above, its brightness creating a link to the woman’s package below. Despite the solidity of the wall, the passersby and flowing fabric suggest the ephemerality of this fleeting moment.
 This sculpture of a young girl, posed as the young goddess Diana with her dog and bow and arrows, demonstrates how Paul Manship sought to meld ideal form inspired by classical Greek and Roman sculpture with a distinctly modern simplicity. He exercised careful control in forming the regularized volumes and polished surface, and added a touch of delicacy with the gilt detailing on the costume and hair. Vivian St. George was the only child of the Irish painter Sir William Orpen and the married American heiress Evelyn St. George. Manship received the portrait commission through his friend the American painter John Singer Sargent, with whom he lived briefly in London in the early 1920s.
 Although Francois Jourdain was known primarily as a painter, he was also an accomplished designer and a founding member of the Union des Artistes Modernes, an important group of avant-garde designers. This adjustable chair is rendered in the Art Moderne style, which is characterized by simple, bold curves. The use of exotic mahogany and cane alludes to the French colonial empire, still partially intact during this period. The chair was manufactured by Jourdain’s own firm, Les Ateliers Modernes.
 When the American photographer Berenice Abbott returned to New York in 1929 after nearly a decade in France, she found a city transformed by modern life. After the Works Progress Administration was established a few years later, she was hired to document the city, producing a large number of often dramatically composed images reflecting its changing features. In this image, Abbott photographed the Trinity and U.S. Realty Buildings (1904−07) on Broadway and Thames Street in the southern part of Manhattan. Older buildings and warehouses sit in the shadow of twentieth-century office towers. Abbott’s steep perspective emphasizes the contrasts in scale and the break between old and new.
 In the late 1950s and early 1960s Idelle Weber began adapting the style of eighteenth-century silhouette portraiture to the Pop idiom. All of the artist’s works included here feature this approach, which imbues her subjects with an anonymous, everyman character. Subjects like Ben Casey, the doctor-hero of a melodramatic 1960s television series, become flat representations of cultural stereotypes; for Weber, the literal flatness of the figures is analogous to the superficial renderings of pop culture characters. In other examples, Weber depicts the quotidian—people on an escalator or skipping rope—with a cold precision. In Munchkins I, II & III, Weber portrays nondescript businessmen in New York’s PanAm (now MetLife) building, one of the world’s largest office buildings at the time, in the middle of the drudgery of their daily commute.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
Chapultepec, or “Grasshopper Hill,” was the first Mexica settlement in the Valley of Mexico, and this carved aquamarine grasshopper pendant may have a symbolic association with the site. Located on the western shore of Lake Texcoco, Chapultepec Hill was a source of fresh water for the capital city of Tenochtitlán. It was also a sacred mountain shrine for Mexica rulers, who had their portraits carved in the rock cliffs. For the Mexica, grasshoppers signified the end of the rainy season, when crops started to grow. Chapultepec, o “Cerro Saltamontes,” fue el primer asentamiento Mexica en el Valle de México, y este pendiente en forma de saltamontes de aguamarina tallada puede tener una asociación simbólica con el lugar. Ubicado en la costa oeste del Lago Texcoco, el cerro de Chapultepec era una fuente de agua fresca para la ciudad capital de Tenochtitlán. Era también un santuario de montaña sagrado para los gobernantes Mexica, quienes hacían tallar sus retratos en los acantilados de piedra. Para los Mexica, los saltamontes significaban el fin de la temporada lluviosa, cuando los cultivos comenzaban a crecer.
 This painting commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad and the third imam, or leader, of the Shica Muslims. Husayn was killed by the forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I (r. 680–683) in the desert of Karbala in central Iraq in 680 c.e. This battle emphasizes the divide between the Sunni and Shica branches of Islam; Husayn led a resistance against what the Shica Muslims believed was the Umayyads’ illegitimate rule. The focus of this painting is Husayn’s half brother, cAbbas, mounted on a white horse as he stabs a member of Yazid’s army. Individual episodes related to the agonies suffered by Husayn and his companions leading up to and during the battle are illustrated in smaller-scale vignettes on the left. The hereafter is shown at the right, with Husayn and his companions in heaven above and their opponents in hell below.“Coffeehouse” Paintings Paintings such as The Battle of Karbala show how the monumental genre, developed for the Zand and Qajar courts (see paintings displayed nearby), was reinterpreted for popular audiences during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This account of Husayn’s martyrdom inspired annual reenactments through ceremonial processions and the tacziya, the ritual theater of Iran. Narrative paintings served as portable backdrops, or pardas (curtains), that could be rolled up and transported from location to location, where a reciter (pardadar) would point to images as he recounted the story. As they were also presented in coffeehouses, such canvases are commonly referred to as qahvakhana, or “coffeehouse,” paintings.
 During most of her life, Ruth Bernhard was interested in depicting the female nude. In this iconic image, one of Bernhard’s most widely recognized and a seminal work of twentieth-century photography, her masterful handling of light and form is put on display. The seemingly sleeping model is framed within a box, emphasizing the horizontal element of the composition and contrasting rectangular regularity with the flow of organic lines. Her left arm breaks away from this constraining enclosure, however, and reaches out of the box in a more comfortable stretch. The play of light and shadow enhances the contours of the body while diffusing the perception of the box, and the body seems to disappear, receding into deep shadows.
 ART OF PRESENTING GENDERArt can play a role in articulating and enacting gender identities, both openly and more subtly. This stool and figure display their respectively male and female bodily sexual characteristics quite directly. The stool would have been used by a Lobi man of high status, with its phallic “foot” protruding to convey his virility and authority. The figure, dedicated to the Yoruba cult of Shango, the orisha (god) of thunder, emphasizes female characteristics of breasts and hairdo. In addition, the bowl held by the figure has sexual and reproductive associations. The two headrests are everyday objects with the same function, though their differing forms are based on the gender of the user. The blocklike form of the man’s headrest contrasts with the more slender form of the woman’s. Even everyday objects such as these can subtly reinforce a strict, binary concept of gender. In addition to cradling the head and protecting often elaborate coiffures during sleep, headrests also serve as emblems of status.
 Victor Gruen, a revolutionary genius in the field of corporate branding and marketing, is now best known as the architect of America’s first enclosed shopping mall. He created this light fixture for Barton’s Bonbonnière, a candy store founded by a fellow Austrian Jewish émigré at Broadway and 81st Street in Manhattan in 1938. In addition to giving the store a large plate-glass façade to entice customers inside, Gruen completely integrated the store’s interior design and retail components, decorating the candy boxes and shopping bags with small colored dots that echoed the painted disks of the lights. A great critical success, the formula was repeated in more than fifty identical stores nationwide by 1952.The ceiling lights were clearly inspired by the kinetic metal mobiles that sculptor Alexander Calder began making in Paris in the 1930s. They are an excellent example of the blurring of the boundaries between the so-called high and low arts that characterized the twentieth century.
 Although experiments with the notion of wireless communication date back to the mid-nineteenth century, the first radio transmission in the United States occurred in 1920. New technology required new forms, and as the household radio rapidly gained in popularity throughout the twenties and thirties, many designers devised different forms. Walter Dorwin Teague’s radios from the mid-1930s are among the most iconic early designs. The streamlined, curving silhouettes of his radios epitomize the Art Moderne, or Art Deco, style that began about 1925. The striking blue mirrored glass seen here was a clever use of a preexisting material to enhance the radio’s sense of newness.
 Charles Eames experimented with molded shell forms for chairs before the war, collaborating with Eero Saarinen on an award-winning chair design in 1940. These experiments were put to good use during the war when Eames and his colleagues used molded plywood technology to develop a lightweight leg splint and a litter for soldiers injured in the field. Just as a chair seat needed to conform to the human body, so did a splint. The ability to mold plywood efficiently into curving shapes had important implications for postwar design.
 One of the few American students of the famous French sculptor Auguste Rodin, Malvina Hoffman also studied equestrian sculpture briefly with the Croatian artist Ivan Mestrovic (1881-1962). While she worked with him, Mestrovic did her portrait and Hoffman modeled what eventually became this over-life-size statue of her mentor. Clad in an open-collared smock and loose trousers, the figure peers intently at the lump of clay waiting to be modeled in his hand. This monumental image portrays Mestrovic, who later settled in the United States, as a heroic artist at the height of his creative powers.
 A dancer and performer himself, Richard Bruce Nugent had a deep affinity for the expressive possibilities of the human body in motion. In this striking image, he depicted dancers and plants as flat, stylized forms rendered in black silhouettes. In the mid-1920s, inspired in part by African art, several artists of the Harlem Renaissance embraced a silhouette aesthetic. As suggested in a verse of Nugent’s poem “Shadow” (1925), the silhouette also had personal significance for the artist, who was African American: Silhouette A silhouette am IOn the face of the moon Lacking colorOr vivid brightness But defined all the clearerBecause I am dark Black on the face of the moon.
 NATIVE AMERICAN PUEBLO POTTERYPottery making was practiced in the southwestern United States for at least two thousand years. Zuni and Cochiti potters created the three vessels here: two water jars and one drum jar, which would have had a hide stretched over the top for beating with drumsticks. Historically, women were the potters, collecting their own clays, coiling and finishing each pot by hand, and firing the pieces in open fires.Pots were often traded and exchanged between pueblos, so that new ideas were constantly being generated. During the 1880s the advent of the railroad brought an influx of trading posts and tourists into the Southwest and entrepreneurial potters began selling to the non-Native market. Today, both male and female potters continue to form traditional works as well as generate exciting new forms of Pueblo pottery.
 At the age of seventy-one, May Wilson left rural Maryland and a decades-long marriage for New York City, where she took up residence at the Chelsea Hotel. Because she was generations older than the avant-garde artists she was drawn to, and being largely self-taught, Wilson acquired the nickname “Grandma Moses of the Underground.” In her Ridiculous Portraits, Wilson collaged ludicrous photo-booth self-portraits onto images she collected from picture postcards, reproductions of famous paintings, mainstream magazines, and soft-core pornography. Produced as personal mementos and often exchanged through the mail with other artists as gifts, her Ridiculous Portraits attacked sexism, ageism, and the cult of beauty with a wry sense of absurdity.
 This Lele mask is closely related to the Kuba mask depicted in Brendan Fernandes’s video As One shown here. The masks chosen for the ballet duet Fernandes composed for As One are known to have been danced in their own distinctive way. The female mask covered with geometric patterns in the video is from the court of the Kuba kingdom, and was originally worn as the face of a female court historian who danced in a carefully choreographed narrative. The Lele make masks that have much in common, both visually and functionally, with those of their neighbors in the central Kuba kingdom, but are much rarer.The Lele sculptor of this mask employed an imaginative and skillful use of pigment to underline volume contrasts such as the convex, almond-shaped eyes—accentuated by multiple eyebrows arranged one atop another—and the pronounced relief of the nose, ears, and scarification marks. Such masks appear principally at the funerals of chiefs and elders but are also used in annual performances that celebrate and teach the history of Lele origins and migrations.

 Historically, Dan society vested political leadership in a council of elders. Masks served as agents of social control, enforcing the council’s rules and orders. The masked figures were believed to be incarnate spiritual beings capable of rendering unbiased judgments. The specific functions of individual masks, once removed from their village contexts, are impossible to determine. Here, the nearly closed eyes and small mouth contrast with those of other masks and probably indicate that this example served in a peacemaking function and generally created harmony in the community. On the other hand, the form of the bu gle mask (no. 2) with projecting eyes and mouth was designed to be deliberately frightening.
 
 Eraminhô are repositories for the souls of the dead. According to Bijagó beliefs, a person’s soul lives on after the body, but only as long as it is remembered by the person’s family. Thus it is necessary to create a repository for the soul and to provide it with sacrifices.
 Margaret Bourke-White was for much of her career the quintessential photojournalist. A major contributor to Life magazine, starting with its inaugural edition in 1936, Bourke-White was the first of dozens of female photojournalists who appeared, and then disappeared, during the golden age of news magazines in the mid-twentieth century. Her precision and strong sense of design were formed while working as an industrial photographer, glamorizing the steel industry and urban architecture. In 1930 Bourke-White was the first Western photographer allowed to take pictures in the Soviet Union. This perfectly composed, beautifully lit photograph shows infants at mealtime in a Soviet orphanage. Light plays on the almost identical heads of the sexually indeterminate three-year-olds, solemnly sharing milk and bread at a child-size table with a spotless white tablecloth.
 To render the three-dimensional volume of the female form, Bradley Walker Tomlin created delicate tonal modulations by dragging and rubbing a Conté crayon across the textured surface of the paper. Intersecting Cubist planes, lightly sketched on the figure’s lower back, hint at an underlying abstract structure, while accents of watercolor around the figure add a decorative touch. Best known for his mature Abstract Expressionist paintings, Tomlin destroyed much of his early work, of which Back is a rare surviving example.
 John Wenger’s view of the amusements at Coney Island (painted his first year as a watercolorist) is extremely lively, owing primarily to the artist’s nervous line and the play of light and color patterns. Born outside of Odessa, Russia, Wenger immigrated to the United States in 1903 and by the twenties was established as a theatrical painter. In his work for the Ziegfeld Follies and the Metropolitan Opera, he honed his skills in designing scenes infused with a dramatic energy.
 A New York sculptor who began to gain recognition for his work in the 1930s, Chaim Gross produced innumerable figure studies in ink and wash on which he based his figurative wood carvings. In this more developed scene done independently of his sculptural work, one still sees the artist’s primary attention to the sculptural outline of forms; color, in the form of watery washes, is added as more of a secondary element.
 A painter, sculptor, educator, and graphic artist, Tom Lias did not achieve the fame of the leading artists of the time. His work nonetheless exemplifies many of the same qualities. Here, Lias unites certain formal characteristics of the period’s painting with the prevalent graphic-design principles in a composition of architectural spaces.

 Although best known as a lithographer of caricatured figure subjects, Adolf Dehn also worked with other media and subjects, including landscape watercolors. Dehn’s primary work in a black-and-white print medium may have led him to emphasize strong contrasts of light and dark, enhanced here by areas of drawing with a soft pencil or chalk. Although his talent for expressive form is also visible, this work is most impressive for Dehn’s dynamic control of the dark washes that broadly but forcefully define the jutting rock cliffs.
 Although born in Germany and educated in New York, Vladimir Kagan was an enthusiastic proponent of Scandinavian design. Opening in 1950, his showroom on Fifty-seventh Street in midtown Manhattan, New York, was one of the first independent design stores to offer both furniture and interior design services in this new style.
 In direct emulation of the famous John Singer Sargent, whom he had met in London, the society portraitist Gordon Stevenson adopted the practice of painting landscapes in watercolor during his summer travels. The lasting impact of Sargent’s innovative approach and technical freedom in the medium—developed during the first decade of the century—is visible in Stevenson’s effort to achieve a similar degree of coloristic brilliance and in his deft manipulation of liquid washes.
 Millard Sheets made this work on the spot while traveling through the Kansas Dust Bowl. (Many midwestern farmlands were destroyed by drought and dust storms in the 1930s, and Sheets stated that “the bleakness in the painting is symbolic of the period.”) With his American subject matter and skillful handling of the medium, the California-based artist earned national acclaim for his watercolors at the time, with critics regularly comparing him to the celebrated masters Winslow Homer and Edward Hopper.
 These sleek modernist versions of Pegasus, the flying horse of classical mythology, once flanked the entrances to the New York City Fire Service Pumping Station that still stands on Neptune Avenue between West Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Streets. The station boosted water pressure for fire fighting in outlying areas of Brooklyn. These four pairs of winged horses arise from stylized curving forms that suggest waves or clouds. Their compact double profiles reflect the Art Deco style of the industrial building whose entrances they once adorned. The streamlined design style was widely used in the 1920s and 1930s.

 The depiction of laboring rice harvesters is typical of the work of Thomas Hart Benton, a leader in the American Scene movement of painting the arose in that late 1920s. Benton and his peers deliberately abandoned European-derived subjects and urban setting in favor of imagery drawn from rural America. Born in Missouri and educated in Chicago and Paris, Benton began to seek out these themes in 1926, during the first of the many trips through the Midwest and the South. Focusing on the broad appeal of the commonplace he described American "types" rather than specific individuals and place, and rendered them in a directly expressive, almost caricatured manner.A verbal description of this work is available through Art Beyond Sight, a guide for people with visual impairments.
 Like many artists at work in the 1930s, Maurice Kish was a labor activist whose subject matter revealed his sympathy for industrial workers. At the time he painted this canvas, Kish was a resident of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He often focused his attention on the massive and filthy coal plants and factories that lined the nearby East River. Here, industrial sites tower over faceless laborers, and all is described in the dull, dark tones indicative of the harsh monotony of their lives.
 The features of this uli figure—the large head with pointed beard, the short legs, and the presence of a penis and breasts—are characteristic of a complex set of mortuary ceremonies that developed in the mountainous central part of New Ireland. These attributes may not have been regarded as the stylized features of a particular person, but rather as the essential components of the aggressive strength and nurturing care required of an ideal ruler.
 Myers often depicted the streets, river piers, parks, and playgrounds of New York’s Lower East Side—a neighborhood then populated mainly by poor European immigrants. He especially enjoyed the exceptional energy and vitality of the open-air markets, writing that “the immigrants merge here with New York.”
 After many years abroad, Joseph Pennell settled in Brooklyn Heights in 1921. His upper-story apartment afforded magnificent views of New York, its waterways, and its bridges—all of which were regular subjects in his art. Pennell achieved the tenebrous effects of this work with aquatint, an etching technique in which the picture is conceived in tone rather than line. Aquatint uses a plate coated with a porous, grainy ground. During the bath, acid bites the underlying metal around the tiny grains, thus creating a subtly patterned area that prints as a tonal wash. Varying the bath time for different sections of the plate results in darker or lighter tones.
 Eugene and Elsie Speicher and Robert and Marjorie Henri were close friends of George and Emma Bellows’s and appear often in lithographs that Bellows made in 1921. Here the women enjoy an intimate conversation on the settee in the Bellowses’ sitting room, while the husbands converse in the background. One of the most talented of Henri’s students, Bellows quickly became a popular member of the Henri circle. Speicher (1883–1962) was another Henri student who had become a successful portraitist.
 Aerodynamic streamlining is characteristic of much American industrial and domestic design of the late 1920s and 1930s. Undecorated, curved designs, as seen here, are well suited to machine production and expressive of speed and change. The vanity and stool are made of chromed metal tubing, an innovation in furniture construction pioneered in the early 1920s by Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus, the seminal German school for modern design. It was still a startling new material a decade later. Although the vanity is gender-specific, this stark, modern interpretation has a limited palette and is made of new materials with hard surfaces. Updating an old form, Kem Weber transformed it for the modern woman.
 ART OF THE BODYThese five artworks from throughout Africa display the range of approaches artists have taken to figural representation. They prove that the Western tradition of naturalism—depicting the body precisely as observed in life—is not even remotely the only possibility open to an artist. The Mossi mask celebrates the female form. While it is not an exact replica of the body, the proportions are relatively balanced. The Yoruba tapper, used with a board to draw images during divinations, was carved with more exaggerated proportions, owing to both the shape of the ivory from which it was carved and the functional requirements of the object. The Fang figure has primarily been reduced to a series of cylinders and circles. The legs and hips are conceived as the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders, echoing the cylindrical reliquary box on which the figure sat. The small Nsapo-Nsapo work and the Salampasu figure take the abstraction of the human form even further by greatly exaggerating the proportions. The Nsapo-Nsapo figure’s thin, extended arms and the Salampasu sculpture’s outthrust chest and flexed shoulders suggest different emotional states for these two protective figures—a tense anxiety, perhaps, in one and a tense readiness in the other.
 The surface of this head is lifelike, but its expression may lead us to contemplate the psychic life at play behind the closed eyes. The sculptor Isamu Noguchi modeled this likeness of his uncle Takagi, a Buddhist priest, in gratitude for his hospitality during the artist’s visit to Tokyo in 1931. One of three casts from the original clay sculpture, the head suggests the “closed-eye vision” achieved through meditation.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 William Zorach developed his modernist approach after studying at the progressive Paris art school La Palette. Typical of the work in watercolor that he pursued throughout his career—even after he abandoned oil painting for sculpture in 1922—this magical image was based on a five-month sojourn in Yosemite. Exploiting liquid watercolor washes to create soft-edged forms in gem-like colors, Zorach conveyed the transcendent quality he experienced in that landscape, which he described as “the garden of Eden.”
 Expressive design was always at the heart of Marguerite Zorach’s art. Basing her imagery on some firsthand sketches (in this case made on a trip to Yosemite in 1920), Zorach preferred to work away from her original motifs in nature to achieve a composition independent of direct observation. Employing a decorative approach—with formal patterns and non-naturalistic colors—in a number of media, she initially was best known for her hand-sewn pictorial tapestries, for which her watercolors sometimes served as preparatory designs.
 The art of Karl Schrag, a German émigré to the United States in 1938, was liberated by the war’s end, when he allowed himself to move from politically positioned subjects to the more neutral art of landscape. In 1945 he also began to remake his stylistic approach under the influence of the innovative British printmaker William Stanley Hayter, joining Hayter’s studio, Atelier 17, in Greenwich Village. In both his prints and paintings, Schrag developed a more abstracted use of line with the aim of heightening the sense of motion in the images.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case.

The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 The works in Erwin Hauer’s Continua in the Plane series, of which Intercircles is a part, exhibit a continuity of surface and a sense of potentially infinite expansion. The sculptural forms reveal themselves in various organic patterns as the viewer moves around the work. Although this is an independent piece of sculpture, leading architects and designers of the era, such as Edward Durell Stone, Florence Knoll, and Philip Johnson, incorporated similar works into their interiors as room dividers or light-diffusing walls.
 Popular 1920s burlesque shows featured a newly minted American type—the career chorus girl who was willing to appear barely clad and was able to perform rigorous choreography for a male audience with a taste for machinelike precision. Performers were a favorite subject for the painter Walt Kuhn, who earned extra income as a stage and costume designer for popular entertainments. This chorus girl strikes the quintessential pose of the body-conscious 1920s female, with arms raised and hands behind her head, fully exposing a powdered expanse of chest and shoulders.
 A second-generation American Impressionist, Frederick Carl Frieseke enjoyed an early reputation as a figure painter who, inspired by the figural subjects of Pierre-Auguste Renoir, employed the Impressionist devices of sparkling color and dappled light. Yet many of his compositions, including Le Pouldu Landscape, also express a highly decorative, patterned aesthetic more akin to the works of Nabi artists like Ă?douard Vuillard.The Artist's Daughter is a relatively late work in Frieseke's career and depicts his only child, Frances, one of his favorite models. She is absorbed in the private act of writing in a secluded interior illuminated subtly by sunlight filtered through blinds. Combining the artist's figural interests with an affectionate family portrait, the painting offers an evocative image of subdued color and quiet charm.
 This mask combines many diverse materials to create an image of power. Multiple eyes, warthog tusks, large teeth, and other power symbols such as rifle casings and a beard of authentic and wooden leopard’s teeth form a fierce countenance that frightens away negative forces.
 The Senufo are well known for their elegant sculpture, which is often associated with the Poro, important men's and women's religious society. These figures, often ornamented by body scarification, elaborate coiffures, and jewelry, represent idealized female beauty. This object, called a deble, was used at Poro festivities, such as initiations and funerals. Deble are held by their upper arms and pounded on the ground to mark a rhythm for dancers. The worn arms on this piece show it was used repeatedly.
 Ray Komai's molded plywood chair was manufactured in Brooklyn in 1949, using the latest American technology. Although European designers such as Marcel Breuer and Alvar Aalto designed plywood furniture in the 1930s, it was the Americans Charles and Ray Eames, in the years immediately after World War II, who realized the full potential of this material and bent one sheet of plywood in several directions. Komai's chair adds a sophisticated anthropomorphic twist. If you look closely, the chair's design suggests a human face.
 Bamana masks such as this one are worn and seen only by members of the Komo association, whose members harness the power (nyama) contained in the mask to aid members of the community. Powerful materials—including blood, chewed kola nuts, and millet beer—are applied to the mask, while prayers and sacrifices are offered. The open mouth and the horns, tusks, and porcupine quills symbolize the Komo’s power to punish those who violate its rules.
 In 1959 the Brazilian artist Lygia Clark cofounded Neo-Concretism, a movement that introduced an expressive, participatory component to the rational style of geometric abstraction. Radar-Small is from Clark’s Bichos (Critters) series of sculptures inspired by living organisms and made up of hinged aluminum sheets. Here, the artist intentionally exposes the hinges, which function much as a supportive spinal column for her “living” creations. Clark relied on her viewer to animate the Bichos by opening, closing, and turning them in infinite ways.
 The clean muscularity and precise industrial order presented by Lewis Hine in Power House Mechanic demonstrates the photographer’s shift, in 1919, from a gritty documentary style to what he called “interpretive photography”—an approach intended to raise the stature of industrial workers, who were increasingly diminished by the massive machinery they operated. Despite his concern for the worker, Hine’s use of hand-selected and precisely posed models actually helped to cement the pictorial formulas employed by burgeoning corporate public-relations departments.
 Surrealism, a visual and literary movement founded in 1924, originated as a European response to the First World War. Yves Tanguy painted Surrealist landscapes devoid of human figures throughout his career.Composition and Robe du Matin—created during Tanguy’s self-imposed exile in the United States in the wake of World War II—speak to the irrationality of war and the annihilation of Europe’s people. Using Surrealist free association and unexpected juxtapositions, Tanguy frames vast voids with interlocking forms that resemble body parts and spindly rods. His dreamlike deviations from the natural world reflect Surrealism’s interest in Freudian psychology and the subconscious, and perhaps the postwar landscape of 1946 Europe.
 The Swiss Surrealist Kurt Seligmann explored myth and whimsicality in this painting, where swirling, haunting forms constitute both figures within the landscape and the landscape itself. Mennon refers to a type of butterfly, as well as the father of the god Thor in Norse mythology. The vertical forms suggest the constant movement of a butterfly that, like the legendary Thor, covers many lands on its life journey. Seligmann immigrated to the United States in 1939 to flee the threat of Nazism. He referred to his paintings, inspired by the vast, open terrain he encountered in the American Southwest, as “cyclonic landscapes.”

 In this drawing Isamu Noguchi used a thick paintbrush to apply ink in serpentine lines and slashing strokes. By changing the pressure of his touch and twisting the tip of the brush, he varied the density and width of the outlines over the course of each stroke. Such variations suggest volumetric mass in an otherwise abstracted figure. After studying traditional Chinese brush drawing in Beijing in the early 1930s, Noguchi combined that technique with the reductive approach to form inspired by his mentor, the modernist sculptor Constantin Brancusi. This blending of Eastern and Western influences characterizes the art of Noguchi, who was of Japanese and American descent.
 In this image of a Swiss town blanketed by a heavy snowfall, Beaumont combines a subtle winter palette of whites, grays, and browns with energetic brushwork. He places a black-cloaked figure on a snow-covered track (indicated by gentle modulations in tone), leading the viewer diagonally into the picture and lending a human presence to an otherwise stark scene.
 Here, Pierre Bonnard employs the high vantage point and candid, unidealized approach to the female nude pioneered by his compatriot Degas. Bonnard, however, presents his bather frontally, seated in a full-length bathtub, a luxury not found in many French homes during Degas’s time. His model was his wife, Marthe, whose skin malady required long soaks.
 Using traditional methods of hand-coiled yellow ware and outdoor firing, Nampeyo invented her own abstract designs based on Hopi symbols. This bowl has a stylized eagle tail, abstract bird form, and meandering lines that indicate Hopi migration from the underworld to their homelands. A potter from a young age, Nampeyo later worked with her daughters Annie, Nellie, and Fannie and sold directly through trading-post owner Thomas Keam. In 1905–6 she lived and worked at the Grand Canyon’s Hopi House demonstrating pottery making to tourists.
 The hats in this case were originally worn by initiates into Bwami, the key social organization of Lega society and patron of its great artistic genres. Bwami is a strictly tiered, hierarchical organization through which initiates advance from one state of knowledge to the next.
 The shift in our perception of objects when they are displayed as part of a museum collection can sometimes elevate a practical piece into an art object. On deli counters in the 1940s, this commercial meat slicer would have evoked cleanliness, efficiency, and modernity. In an exhibition, it becomes an almost abstract piece of streamlined design.
 Kenojuak Ashevak’s drawings and prints feature fantastical creatures and bold colors and forms. This captivating image of an arctic owl was among the first prints produced by the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative. It quickly became a Canadian icon, and in 1970 the print was chosen for the country’s commemorative stamp.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 Having established himself in London as an etcher of urban architectural views, Joseph Pennell returned to the United States in 1917 and turned his attention to watercolors of New York subjects. This work is probably one of a series of twenty views titled Out of a Brooklyn Window that Pennell exhibited in the Brooklyn Museum’s 1921 watercolor exhibition. The manner in which Pennell constructed the composition of abbreviated areas of dark and light forms recalls the compositional methods of his English friend and mentor James McNeill Whistler.
 A modernist landscape painter, Oscar Bluemner believed that individual colors embodied specific meanings; red, for example, directly expressed a powerful life force. When the death of his wife in 1926 left him in despair, Bluemner found solace in painting a group of watercolors of vividly toned landscapes with suns and moons that signified the ecstatic transformation of matter into spirit. The atmospheric quality of his watercolor washes infuse his nocturnal subjects with an air of mystery.
 The daughter of prosperous Swiss immigrants, Marie Zimmermann was born in Brooklyn and studied art at the Art Students League and Pratt Institute. Although she was often influenced by Asian and ancient Egyptian art, which she no doubt saw on visits to the Brooklyn Museum, these candlesticks illustrate an affinity with the restrained Anglo-American interpretation of the Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Zimmermann and Elizabeth Copeland, the maker of the nearby box, were among the few women metalsmiths to achieve national fame.
By the time Pierre Legrain designed this stool in the 1920s, the idea of seating furniture as a status symbol had been replaced by the idea that comfort was paramount. In making a stool whose luxury and beauty surpassed its usefulness, Legrain looked back to older ways of thinking. His use of an African model, however, was new and reflected a growing fascination with the arts of Africa among sophisticated Europeans in the 1920s.By turning a traditionally simple African form into a luxury object made of lacquered wood and covered with expensive sharkskin, Legrain reflected the cultural imperialism of his time, when Western artists and designers raided the artistic heritage of the world and remade objects from other cultures to accommodate consumers’ taste.
 
 Although ostensibly a portrait head of a woman from the Caribbean island of Martinique, this sculpture is one of a number of heads based on Malvina Hoffman’s travels through Africa about 1928. The modernized realism of this work signaled a deliberate break with earlier treatments of African subjects ranging from caricature to romanticism. For many years, however, the critical reception of Hoffman’s work remained firmly embedded in racist language and a Eurocentric point of view.
 This headdress is known as zigiren-wunde, or “the new bride.” Entirely secular in nature, it celebrates the role of Baga women in both human and agricultural fertility, and in nurturing the community.The zigiren-wunde is owned and performed by groups of young men solely for entertainment, especially at weddings. The performer wears it on top of the head, grasping the leglike projections at the base of the mask to steady it. These “shoulders” are draped with cloth, leaving the figure’s breasts exposed, and the costume is completed with the addition of a skirt of palm fiber.
 Iginga is a generic Lega term for human figurines owned by the highest-ranking members of Bwami. This example most likely served to mark the right of a specific Lega community to hold higher-level initiation rites. The piece has been cleaned, oiled, and rubbed with white powder many times, giving it a rich patina.
 This female gheonga figure most likely accompanied a male figure in a Bwiti shrine. A gheonga figure represents an ancestor, who is called upon for assistance with problems. Modern Bwiti incorporates animism, veneration of the ancestors, and elements borrowed from Christianity.
 Oötsawihazru Kachina is an Ogre’s Uncle, a so-called White Ogre. These Kachinas are a little more patient than the Black Ogres, such as Chaveyo (seen nearby). Ogres, collectively called Soo’so’yokto, appear near the end of the Powamuya (Bean Dance) ceremony held in February, in which the participating Kachina spirits are implored to carry out purification of all life. Their role as Ogres is to scare people into behaving properly and following the rules. Kachina Oötsawihazru es el Tío de un Ogro, conocido como Ogro Blanco. Estos Kachinas son un poco más pacientes que los Ogros Negros, como Chaveyo (ver Kachina Chaveyo). Ogros, llamados colectivamente Soo’so’yokto, aparecen hacia el final del Powamuya (Danza del Frijol), ceremonia realizada en febrero en la cualse les implora a los espíritus Kachinas participantes la purificación de todo lo vivo. Su rol de Ogros es asustar a la gente para que así se comporten apropiadamente y sigan las reglas.
 Russel Wright created cutlery that both feels good in the hand and presents a sensuous, curving appearance. Designed for production in stainless steel, these pieces reflect a new interest in casual living, with comfort and convenience outweighing outmoded ideas of elegance.

 The child's wheelbarrow is based on a toy that Gerrit Rietveld made in 1923 for the son of J. J. P. Oud, the owner of the armchair also displayed here. The wheelbarrow exemplifies the stylistic characteristics of De Stijl: it is composed of elemental geometric forms—rectangular planes, elongated cylinders, and a disk for the wheel—painted in primary colors and made of inexpensive wood. Revived interest in Rietveld in the mid-twentieth century led to this later production of the wheelbarrow.
 Becoming NewMasquerade is to some extent always “new.” Each performance varies in response to changes in setting, music, costume, audience, and the performers’ movements. However, circumstances sometimes require the invention of totally new types of masquerade to address new issues.Ode-lay is a uniquely urban form of masquerade that developed in Sierra Leone’s capital city of Freetown. This mask likely has its origins in the 1960s or ‘70s, when new genres of film, particularly those from or about Asia, inspired novel mask creations. The crowned central figure on this mask, flanked by two pairs of sinuous snarling serpents, may be directly related to the kung fu movies of the period. The imagery of this mask may also recall that of Mami Wata, a pan-African water goddess recognized throughout West Africa and the Caribbean, whose roots lie in the local adaptation of imagery drawing from India, the Pacific, and Europe.Male Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. The full-body example seen here is a highly unusual artistic reinvention of the gelede form; only about half a dozen are known in Western collections.
 In a rented apartment in Nice, France, Henri Matisse physically distanced himself from Paris and its associations with World War I, the avant-garde style of Cubism, and even his family. There, he focused on Mediterranean light, captured here with fine, parallel hatchings throughout the model’s body. She is a confident nude with an open posture and confrontational gaze, perhaps suggesting Matisse’s interrogation of the traditional role of women in art history as objects of desire.Alice ZhengCuratorial InsightsBrooklyn Museum Teen Mentoring InitiativeSpring 2016
 Josef Albers’s Homage to the Square series is a study of the illusionistic effects of color. Starting with the rigorous geometry of nested squares, Albers created these works by applying paint directly from the tube and spreading it onto the Masonite board with a palette knife. The juxtaposed slabs of color play off one another, as some squares seem to recede into space while others float into the foreground. Albers pursued this study of color and perception from 1950 until his death, producing nearly a thousand canvases in the series.
 This is one of several paintings Pablo Picasso created in quick succession in Paris during World War II. In this fractured bust-length portrait of a woman wearing a veil and broad-brimmed hat, the artist’s abstractions evoke the violence and bleakness of life in the German-occupied French capital.
 Hampatong is a general term for a statue or figure. These figures might have served a number of different purposes. In this instance, since both male and female images are depicted, it is likely that they represent a mythical ancestral couple. Such ancestors are believed to protect a village by warding off evil spirits. Dayak art is distinguished by the incorporation of many, floral motifs and curvilinear designs, as seen on the hats that these figures are wearing.
 To honor deceased family members, villagers kept carved wooden figures to contain the souls of their ancestors in the family house. This seated figure (iene) from Leti has elongated limbs drawn close to the body and rests on a pedestal. The extension from the forehead may indicate the rank of the deceased.
 Arakawa Toyozo, an apprentice of Kitaoji Rosanjin, devoted his life to re-creating Shino and yellow-and-black Seto wares of the Momoyama period. He eventually received the Japanese honor of being designated a Living National Treasure. The donor of this object relates the fascinating story of her meeting with the artist in 1956. Together they viewed the famous Chinese painting of six persimmons (kaki) by the Song artist Mu Ch'i (active thirteenth century), which was on view in an exhibition of treasures in a Japanese museum.Arakawa went back to his studio and fashioned this small incense box in the form of the fruit, firing it with the simple but effective decoration technique known as nezumi-Shino (gray Shino). He then gave it to Mrs. Conant as a memento of their experience.
 This side chair is an intentional, faithful copy of a chair made more than one hundred years earlier by the famous New York City cabinetmaker Duncan Phyfe. Made out of the same expensive materials as the original Phyfe chair, it is an example of the Colonial Revival style that began about the time of the United States centennial in 1876 and continued well into the twentieth century. Out of a desire to define themselves and their place in the world, Americans began to look back proudly to their past. They then began to build colonial-style houses and fill them with early American–style furniture such as this chair.
 Augustus Aaron Wilson, a retired lighthouse keeper, is best known for his duck decoys and other small carvings. When the Ringling Brothers circus came to town in 1931, he was inspired by Emyr, said to be the largest tiger in captivity, to carve these tigers from salvaged railroad ties and telephone poles that he kept in his barn. The smaller of these two works is thought to be the earlier attempt.
 Because of its low cost and easy care, plastic attracted both consumer and designer in the postwar era. Russel Wright worked with the chemical company American Cyanamid to develop a line of dinnerware from its patented plastic, Melamine. Although that venture was not successful, Wright soon found other companies to produce his designs for plastic dinnerware. Originally intended for institutional use, plastic dinnerware also found a place at home, and by 1957 Wright’s Residential line, produced by Northern Industrial Chemical, had door-to-door sales of $4 million.

 Though separated by several generations, Jervis McEntee and Marsden Hartley both employed emotive styles to express personal impressions of landscape rather than faithful transcripts of nature. In A Cliff in the Katskills (at left), McEntee rendered a well-known natural landmark in the Catskill Mountains with thickly applied daubs of paint, in a departure from the studious detail typical of mid-nineteenth- century landscape painting. The drama of McEntee’s painting, with its imposing boulder and foreboding clouds, is echoed in Marsden Hartley’s seascape. A Maine native, Hartley used an expressionist style of rough brushstrokes, bold outlines, and compressed space to depict the churning sea crashing against the rocky shore.

 The Great Depression imposed severe emotional and financial hardships on many people, including Hartley, who in 1935 was living on sixty cents a day. Relief came when a patron sent the exhausted painter to Bermuda, where the tropical atmosphere revived his flagging spirits. There he concentrated on fish and floral still-life subjects
 Often there is an occult attraction in the very shape of a rock as sheer abstract form. It fascinates with a queer atavistic nostalgia, as either a remote memory or a stirring impulse from the depth of the unconscious. My aim is to produce a sculpture feeling as direct and swift as drawing, a sculpture with such ease, freedom and simplicity that it hardly feels carved, but rather to have always been there. . . . —John Flannagan
 Hartley's penchant for the poetic was satisfied by the boulder-strewn landscape of Dogtown Common, an abandoned agricultural community near Gloucester, Massachusetts, whose origins dated to the seventeenth century. The desolate aspects of the scenery fired his imagination, and he later described the place as "a cross between Easter Island and Stonehenge--essentially druidic in its appearance--it gives the feeling that an ancient race might turn up at any moment and renew an ageless rite there."
 By 1940, Mark Rothko—deeply impressed by the European Surrealists, some of whom came to this country during World War II—integrated their technique of automatic drawing and their interest in myth into his own work and moved away from the direct representation seen in his earlier art. Reflecting on this time, Rothko later said: "It was with utmost reluctance that I found that the figure could not serve my purposes … but a time came when none of us could use the figure without mutilating it." Rothko's work of the mid-1940s is an amalgam of Surrealism and abstraction. Vessels of Magic anticipates these works with horizontal registers on the paper's surface broken only by passages of imagery and gesture. The vessel forms may suggest the artist's interest in classical mythology, while the image's watery quality has a primordial, mythic nature that suggests something of humankind's origins as well as the power of magic.
 Utilizing traditional hand-coiling techniques, vessel forms, and open-trench firing, Maria Martinez invented a unique style of pottery featuring black-on-black designs (as seen here), which had never been done before. Martinez began potting to provide income for her family, collaborating with her husband, Julian, and later her son, Popovi Da, as painters. She eventually became world-famous, attracting visits from Japanese masters who wanted to learn her techniques. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., invited her to help with the dedication of New York’s Rockefeller Plaza in 1933.
 Ad Reinhardt said of his flat, geometric abstract paintings: "The content is not in a subject matter or story but in the actual painting activity." Although Reinhardt was a contemporary of the Abstract Expressionists, his art differs greatly from that of Jackson Pollock or Willem de Kooning, whose works are composed of random, gestural brushstrokes. Rather, in paintings like Untitled (Composition #704), Reinhardt's control over his canvas is revealed in solid bricklike blocks of color. The work is strictly composed to deny depth and affirm symmetry.
 THE JARVIS COLLECTIONThe articles in this case and the adjacent clothing case [see 50.67.6] are some of the earliest and finest Eastern Plains pieces in existence. They were collected by Dr. Nathan Sturges Jarvis, a military surgeon stationed at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, between 1833 and 1836. Most items were made by the Eastern and Middle Dakota (Sioux) or by the peoples of the Red River region, including the Red River Métis, Anishinabe, Plains Cree, and Salteaux. Some of the objects were purchased by Jarvis, and others may have been given to him in exchange for his medical services.By the early nineteenth century, the growing numbers of white settlers and military personnel—following decades of fur trading—had depleted much of the game on which the Dakota and Red River peoples depended. Indigenous ingenuity in combining trade materials such as cloth, metal, and glass beads with traditional hides, pipestone, and porcupine and bird quills is evident in these objects.
 Ceramics have a long-standing tradition in the southwestern pueblos dating from 7500 B.C.E. to the present day. Originally all pottery production was for Native use, and specific shapes, designs, and colors can be attributed to specific pueblos. The Hopi—Pueblo people living in the southwestern United States—began making tiles for decoration in the nineteenth century. Their designs mirrored the abstracted motifs used on their pottery. By the early twentieth century, especially after the advent of the Santa Fe railroad in the 1870s, non-Native merchants and collectors passing through the region created a demand for portable Native tokens. Entrepreneurial Native potters made small bowls and decorative tiles using traditional Hopi and Pueblo designs to fulfill this commercial opportunity.
 Adolph Gottlieb was an Abstract Expressionist painter whose subjects and forms were derived from sources including African and Native American art. His series of Pictographs (1941–51) related to the beliefs and myths of these cultures, from which he created a unique visual language. Premonition of Evil, painted just after the end of World War II, depicts fragments of the human body in divided areas of the composition. Searching eyes stare out at the viewer through the windows in Gottlieb's informal grid.
 In 1942, the collector Peggy Guggenheim sought advice from the architect and designer Frederick Kiesler on how to remodel two shops on West Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan into a gallery for Surrealist and American art. Kiesler responded with plans for Art of This Century, the now-legendary gallery that became a focal point of the avant-garde. There, paintings were shown without frames, a Surrealist room incorporated curved walls, and pictures were displayed mounted on the ends of baseball bats projecting from the walls. With a nod to Surrealism’s freedoms, the gallery’s organic table could be tilted or turned upside down, becoming a pedestal to show sculpture, or an easel to display a painting, or a chair shaped to the curve of the seated figure and a companion piece to the rocking chair.
 Aaron Siskind’s photographs isolate, and render almost abstract, details of the outdoors from both natural and urban settings. His images are often considered the photographic equivalent of Abstract Expressionism, in that they look “painterly” and evoke the gestural abstraction of the New York School.
 Like all serious artists of their generation, Sloan and his friends often sketched and painted from the nude. This sketch of a woman seated on a draped studio prop is typical of Sloan’s many naturalistic depictions of the female body. Captured in a casual, unrefined pose, she appears refreshingly authentic and unidealized.
 Edward Weston gained international recognition early in his career with work from the portrait studio that he operated in California from 1911 to 1922. After meeting Alfred Stieglitz and other prominent modernists in New York in the early 1920s, he became disenchanted with the soft-focused Pictorialist style he had mastered so successfully. He returned to California to experiment with hard-edged, sharp-focused studies of nudes, organic forms, and landscapes, while his work became at the same time more abstract, often juxtaposing curvaceous forms with more geometric patterns. Weston was the first photographer ever to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, in 1937 (and again in 1938), at a time when he worked entirely outdoors with the limitless possibilities of the Western landscape. In this image from 1939, made immediately following his fellowship work, the weight and ambiguous scale of the driftwood convey a sense of monumentality. The complexity of forms and surfaces is the focus of the image, and the delicate layer of fog heightens the wood’s texture, rendering it almost palpable. The strong relationship between the drift stump and the scattered pieces of wood around it unifies the composition.
 Cameroonian masks usually carry gender associations. This is a male mask, identified by its headdress and beard. Frequently worn in ensemble performances, such masks can be seen at funeral celebrations of elders and other prominent people, as well as at annual festivals demonstrating loyalty to the fon, or king.
 Headdresses covered with leather are found only in the Cross River area of Cameroon. Some are fiercely stylized while others are startlingly realistic and may in fact have been portraits of individuals.The artist carves the form from a single piece of wood and then covers it with untanned antelope skin that has been soaked for several days, scraped, and smoothed. He stitches, pegs, and ties the skin into place and allows it to dry. Eyes, ears, scarification patterns, and hair are carved and covered separately, then pegged onto the finished piece. Finally, the piece is painted prior to performance.
 The strong three-dimensionality of the biomorphic and geometric forms in this composition makes them appear animated within a space bounded by color zones. Charles Biederman had been experimenting with progressive modern European styles since 1930 and had gravitated toward greater abstraction after seeing the work of Cubist artists such as Pablo Picasso, newly on view in New York. He painted this work while living in Paris in 1936, under the fresh influence of the Surrealists Joan Miró and Fernand Léger, who preferred strange or oddly combined forms that were both unsettling and humorous.
 
 Playfully evoking the molecular structures revealed by the electron microscope, the Hang-It-All was designed with children in mind. The colored balls, for hanging coats, hats, and scarves, seem to move around each other as one passes by. Although by no means a literal model of molecules or atoms, the Hang-It-All transforms the popular scientific imagery of the 1950s into a dynamic design.
 The unusual and otherworldly subject of a small mother-and-child group held aloft by two large disembodied hands in this drawing typifies the imagery of the artist and writer Kahlil Gibran. Like his fellow Symbolist Elihu Vedder (whose work is displayed nearby), Gibran was preoccupied with the transcendence of the soul and the universal experiences of love, spirituality, and the life cycle. The Burden alludes to themes of maternal responsibility and the role of a divine agent guiding human endeavors.
 Rather than working a watercolor rapidly, the mid-twentieth-century landscape watercolorist William Thon tended to devote numerous sessions of work to each sheet, always painting indoors, where he could best control the drying rates of washes and ink drawings. As a result, Thon’s watercolors have denser, more built-up surfaces than the modernist watercolors of the teens and twenties. Thon particularly liked the interplay of the successive layers of wash and ink and the fortuitous blurring that often occurred.
 Louise Nevelson described this sculpture as “one of the first major pieces” she created. The “personage’s” undulating frontal slab suggests a composed, outer persona, and the spiky column behind, an inner, agitated, true self. Nevelson later recalled that the work’s persona emerged in the process of creation: “While I was filing and working away at it, there was a knot where the mouth was supposed to be, just a plain knot, and I, being so concentrated, all of a sudden I saw this knot, mouth moving. And the whole thing was black by then and it frightened me.”
 Herzl Emanuel has vivid recollections about the origins of this work:Upon returning to the U.S. from four years in Paris, I found a studio on Columbia Heights in Brooklyn. It had a rear garden from which I could see the grand bridge majestically spanning the East River to the distant cluster of towering buildings of lower Manhattan. The assortment of visual elements was extremely rich . . . the astonishing structure of the bridge itself, the varied shapes and architectural styles of the soaring buildings, the river traffic, the streets paved with cobble stones, brick walls and archways, steps and streetcar tracks and overhead, banks of cumulous clouds. . . . The challenge was to organize all this seductive material into a coherent structure. My efforts at the time clearly reflected my immersion with the cubist development.
 This object creates a frightening and otherworldly effect. Gbaule are divination objects used by the We to determine the causes of illness and to identify evil forces. A diviner holds the gbaule while in a trance. He is asked questions, and the movement of the gbaule indicates a response.The divination society associated with this object was created by a man of the neighboring Krou people who had served as a soldier in France in World War I, and it became quite popular in the following decade. This origin explains why a head such as this one is also called a commandant.
 Like the Hang-It-All, The Bamboozler uses atom-derived, space-age shapes to “bamboozle” children into thinking that hanging up their clothing is fun. The designer, Richard Neagle, marketed The Bamboozler through magazine and newspaper ads that claimed: “Small fry might suppose it’s a convertible spaceship what with the revolving hat rack at the top. . . . [It] has been carefully designed so that your range rovers will find it quite a problem to knock it over.”
 To honor deceased family members, villagers kept carved wooden figures to contain the souls of their ancestors in the family house. This male figure (adu zafua) grasping two short rods wears an elaborate headdress symbolizing the tree of life.
 In this photograph, Chris Holley, winner of the twenty-seventh annual Modern Venus beauty contest, waves to the crowds from the Parachute Jump, a ride that debuted at the 1939 New York World’s Fair before being moved to Steeplechase Park in 1941. Based on a design patented by a retired Naval commander to train paratroopers, the Parachute Jump was a symbol of war that became a popular amusement ride, particularly with men who had served in World War II.
 Returning to New York in 1929 after nearly a decade in France, Berenice Abbott found a city transformed by modern life. Hired by the Works Progress Administration to document the city, she produced a large number of often dramatically composed images reflecting the city’s changing features. Abbott shot the Daily News Building looking toward the East River. Located on Forty-second Street between Third and Second avenues, the 1930 skyscraper provided a striking contrast with low-rise houses on nearby streets. It was part of a new booming business district in midtown, spurred by the completion of Grand Central Terminal in 1913. The residential Tudor City in the background had been completed in 1928, shielding what was still in the 1930s an industrial area on the East River. Although the power plant on the river exists today, the Second Avenue elevated train line was torn down in 1942.
 In a group of New York City street scenes from the 1930s, John Marin reverted to a more conventionally Cubist compositional technique better suited to the geometries of urban architecture than to rural landscapes or coastal views. In these works, drawing and watercolor are almost equally balanced: heavy outlines of planar forms, including the stylized shapes of moving figures, are enhanced by earth-toned washes that lend them relative depth.
 This highly animated figure is the work of an exceptionally gifted artist from the Wapo/Era area of the Gulf province of Papua New Guinea. Small silhouette figures of this type, called bioma, are usually placed near the floor within the men's ceremonial house in proximity to trophy skulls of pigs and crocodiles. Characteristically, bioma figures from this area are flat with two sets of limbs, one upraised, one lowered, with ridged edges along the outer sides. The extraordinary vitality of this figure is a result of its having been cut from a curved slab of wood that was probably part of an old canoe. John W. Vandercook, one of the most famous traveler-adventurers and writers of his day, likely collected the piece between 1929 and 1933.
 Japanese merchants considered the easily moveable kuruma dansu, which kept valuables and merchandise in order the storehouse, an essential possession. The chests were often included as part of a daughter's dowry. The kuruma dansu displayed here, crafted in Yamagata Prefecture, is of exceptionally high quality. The frame and door panels are zelkova wood, the finest wood used in Japanese furniture construction. The entire chest is finished in a kijiri lacquer to accentuate the wood's naturally elegant grain.
 Both men and women wore large hoop earrings as amulets to prevent evil spirits from entering the ears.
 Because of its low cost and easy care, plastic attracted both consumer and designer in the postwar era. Russel Wright worked with the chemical company American Cyanamid to develop a line of dinnerware from its patented plastic, Melamine. Although that venture was not successful, Wright soon found other companies to produce his designs for plastic dinnerware. Originally intended for institutional use, plastic dinnerware also found a place at home, and by 1957 Wright’s Residential line, produced by Northern Industrial Chemical, had door-to-door sales of $4 million.
 A self-taught artist, John Costigan preceded each of his watercolors with a series of compositional drawings on the same scale intended for the finished work. He drew the composition, once resolved, onto the final sheet (his graphite lines are readily visible here) before applying his washes in a more spontaneous manner. Throughout his mature career, Costigan found his subjects at or near the farm he owned in rural Orangeburg, New York.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 ART OF POWERAlthough art has historically glorified the powerful, it can also be a means of communication and expression for those without power. These Congolese works represent opposite ends of the social spectrum. The mwaash aMbooy mask is emblematic of royal power and prestige for the Kuba kingdom of the central Congo. It represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba trace their descent, and is worn only by the king (nyim) or by local chiefs. In both its dance and as a sculpture, it is a vision of gravity and composure. The contemporary portraits by Aimé Mpane, in turn, depict the struggles of those without access to power. They show ordinary citizens of Kinshasa, along with representations of their fears and desires. The artist carves these images from plywood, turning two-dimensional surfaces into works filled with light and shadow (suggesting both presence and absence) that animate the stories of the dispossessed.
 We rarely know the names of past African artists, but Ali Amonikoyi is an exception, largely because he was a distinctive artistic innovator. He used metalworking techniques to make objects normally carved in wood and then used these objects in a nontraditional context. Moreover, he produced his works in proximity to colonial officials who observed and recorded his personal and artistic history.Amonikoyi was a Yoruba born in Nigeria who migrated to Togo. There he used ancient brass-casting techniques to make mask forms resembling Yoruba gelede masks. These masks were placed on top of graves as memorials to the deceased, rather than being worn in dance performances.

 This necklace would have been worn by a young man along with an ensemble of other necklaces, belts, and head, arm, and leg bands as an indication of his new adult status, following circumcision. Visually setting off the head from the rest of the torso, it would have provided a background for other beaded neck ornaments.
 Blanche Lazzell made this group of objects—part of a larger suite of fourteen works—as an artistic exercise while studying in Paris with the Cubist Albert Gleizes. They provide a fascinating glimpse into Lazzell’s process of transforming a townscape into an abstract composition. The graphite drawings show her progression from a relatively representational image of an urban plaza with buildings, stairways, and trees to ever more reductive, abstract shapes that she rearranged and filled with different patterns and tones, culminating in the watercolor. This kind of experimentation allowed Lazzell to explore the expressive possibilities of abstraction, in keeping with Gleizes’s theories that the juxtaposition of flat forms—through their relation to each other and the paper surface—provides a new way to signify spatial depth.
 This is a unique work of art that bridges conventional easel painting and tile making. Original hand decoration on ceramics, termed “China painting” in the nineteenth century, was practiced both by professional artisans such as Mitchell and by amateur hobbyists. The notion of hobbies was born in the late nineteenth century as the growing prosperity of the middle class allowed for leisure activities. Handmade objects for the home were considered constructive projects to occupy housewives during their new free time.
 The gentleman photographed here is Zill al-Sultan (1850–1919), the governor of Isfahan and the brother of Muzaffar al-Din Shah. Sevruguin’s portraits often show the subjects posed as for a painting, dressed in characteristic attire. Attributes such as the elaborate, feathered helmet, hilted sword, and uniform studded with medals and the Imperial Order of the Lion and Sun underline the sitter’s military identity and high status. The photographer’s signature can be found to the right of the photograph in Cyrillic script.
 The starting point for this lively patterned abstraction was an earlier canvas by Stuart Davis entitled House and Street, 1931. Treating each subsequent version as a riff on a jazz theme, Davis moved further and further away from his original composition to establish independent, rhythmic color patterns that retained only a few direct visual cues to the original composition. Davis theorized that abstract compositions could communicate to the viewer something of the subject from which they were derived. This composition embodies the “mellow pad”—jazz lingo for the “cool” place to be. Jazz rhythms were a potent inspiration for Davis, and their presence added a distinctly American component to his abstractions.
 Pad No. 4 is one of a series of four related pictures that Stuart Davis made while working on The Mellow Pad, a painting in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection. In all of these works, the word pad appears—here, sideways in green at the upper left (and a 4 is in white at the lower right). This title reveals the artist’s fondness for wordplay: pad refers both to an artist’s sketchbook and to the jazz slang term for “home.” A lifelong aficionado of jazz, Davis regularly drew analogies between the visual patterns of his pictures and the syncopated rhythms of this modern form of American music.
 Visually, this whimsical salt and pepper set bridges the gap between a sculpture by Hans Arp and Al Capp’s curious cartoon “shmoo” characters, reflecting the delight with soft, curving forms in art from high to low. Just as important from a design point of view, however, is the relationship of these objects to the hand that holds them, and their function as shakers. The lower body of the shaker fits snugly in the palm of the hand, the forefinger wraps around the neck, and seasonings are cast effortlessly from the head.
 Designers such as Eva Zeisel created objects with softly curving forms based on nature. Postwar manufacturers such as Red Wing, interested in good modern design, were able to bring these forms to the style-conscious American consumer at a reasonable price.
 Mara McAfee infuses her work with playful puns and witty commentary. Her art places familiar images from comic books, like the sleekly masculine figures of Marvelous Modern Mechanical Men, into a more traditionally high-art landscape. Combining popular imagery with a painterly execution—an aesthetic choice different from the intentionally flat coloring of many other Pop artists—allows McAfee to challenge the boundary between high and low from a different angle. Many of her pieces (such as You Can’t Catch Me, shown here) are almost cinematic in composition, creating a narrative structure that aids her humorous intentions.
 The magazine Good Furniture commented in 1927 that Paul T. Frankl “has developed one feature that is absolutely unique. This is the now somewhat celebrated skyscraper type of furniture, which is as American and as New Yorkish as Fifth Avenue itself.” Indeed, what could be more American and modern than furniture based on this unique contribution to architecture—the skyscraper. Frankl, who was creating furniture of this type by 1925, was one of the first modern designers of American decorative arts.
Serpentine curves inspired by natural forms were a mainstay of O’Keeffe’s art from the earliest years of her career. Later on, she found new pictorial opportunities in the aerial view, which she discovered when she flew across the country and around the world in the lower-altitude propeller planes of the 1950s and 1960s. In this work, which suggests the ribbon-like meander of a Western river through arid terrain, her reference to place is almost entirely subsumed by the force of the calligraphic, abstract design.
 The Pedernal is a flat-topped mountain that commands the Ghost Ranch landscape and is visible for miles in every direction. O’Keeffe was inspired by its unusual topography and regal presence. It became for her what Mount Fuji was for Hokusai or Mont Sainte-Victoire for Paul Cézanne—a compelling natural feature to be explored again and again in different compositions. Late in life, she liked to tell interviewers that she thought if she painted the Pedernal often enough, God would give it to her.

 Tiffany iridescence was imitated by other manufacturers. The most successful of these was Frederick Carder, whose “Aurene” glass rivaled the beauty of Tiffany’s “Favrile” line.
 From the outset, Coney Island’s amusements offered middle-class New Yorkers the freedom to spend their hard-won moments of leisure in an atmosphere of unfettered frivolity. Various rides offered the sexes an unusual degree of unmonitored contact that would have scandalized proper Victorians. In this vivid Depression-era painting of one of the wild “bowls,” in which friends and strangers alike were thrown into contact by the overpowering centrifugal force, the figure painter Reginald Marsh described the chaotic tangle of their bodies with the sensual physicality for which his work was best known.
 Every Northwest Coast family had a supply of spoons. Those for common household purposes were of the same shape and materials as feast spoons, though undecorated. Feast spoons such as this example were brought out, in the same way as fine china or best silverware in other cultures, when a family gave a celebratory feast or when visitors arrived from another village. The number of feast spoons was determined by the magnificence of the feast the family could afford. This Haida spoon was delicately carved from a single piece of goat horn and decorated with five animal heads, each with abalone-shell eyes. Before carving, the horn was steamed until pliable, bent into shape, and cooled in a mold.
 This woven storage basket echoes the shape of a Pueblo water jar. Smaller versions of this form would have been lined with pitch and used, with a lid, to hold water, wild grass seeds, or domesticated corn and beans. By the late nineteenth century, the shape was enlarged for the thriving art market. Exact meanings of each design have been lost, but figures depicted with horns, as seen here, usually refer to power coming from or going to the sky. The woven, interlocking forms of light and dark suggest the Apache belief of complete harmony with all elements of the universe.Esta cesta de almacenaje tejida hace eco de la forma de las ollas de agua Pueblo. Versiones más pequeñas de esta forma pueden haberse recubierto con alquitrán y usado, con una tapa, para contener agua, semillas de pasto salvaje, o maíz y frijoles domesticados. Hacia finales del siglo diecinueve, la forma se agrandó para acomodar el floreciente mercado artístico. El significado exacto de cada diseño se ha perdido, pero figuras representadas con cuernos como las que se ven aquí, usualmente significan poder que proviene o va hacia el cielo. Las formas tejidas interconectadas claras y oscuras sugieren la creencia Apache de completa armonía con todos los elementos del universo.
 With its imaginative arrangement of an infant, a cow pull toy, and other objects of personal significance, this drawing constitutes a symbolic portrait of the artist, who developed an idiosyncratic style combining Eastern and Western influences. Here the tipped-up perspective and asymmetrical composition suggest a Japanese aesthetic, while the figural distortions are indebted to American and European modernism. In the early 1920s, before turning to painting, Yasuo Kuniyoshi embraced the traditional Eastern practice of ink drawing, yet he manipulated the medium in unconventional ways, creating a range of textures and tones through the varied application of broad washes and delicate lines.
 In the early 1900s this Northwest Coast potlatch figure would have been called "primitive" art, as if it were a simpler version of European-derived art. However, the Native American artist who carved this figure was following the formal artistic traditions of Kwakwaka'wakw society. Potlatch figures were place outside a chief's large house during a potlatch to emphasize his power. At a potlatch, a celebration held for occasions such as births, deaths, marriages, and treaty signings, the chief gave away much of his valuable belongings to the attendees, affirming his wealth and power and obligating the recipients to reciprocate at some future time.
 Study of Two Dancers represents a later phase in the artist’s work, in which highly simplified outlines have replaced heavily worked forms and densely built-up surfaces. During the teens Davies was almost completely absorbed with the theme of dancers in movement, creating endless variations such as this one.

 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

 This lithograph is one of ten scenery and costume designs by El Lissitzky for a puppet version of the 1913 Russian Futurist opera Victory over the Sun, a tale of the clash between technological progress and social order set in a utopian universe. In his interpretation of the opera, Lissitzky emphasized its power imbalances through severely abstracted sets and costumes. His new generation’s politicized avant-garde style, Constructivism, enlisted abstract art as a catalyst not just for spiritual experience but also for social change.
 Josef Albers had a lifelong interest in color’s meditative qualities. With the help of simple color combinations, he aimed to show that flat shapes on a two-dimensional surface can create an illusion of movement and depth. Albers believed that the introduction of a white line into one of the color fields affected the perception of the color on both sides of the line. He felt that experimentation with subtle colors—as in these two works—proved the power of the line and the efficacy of his theory.
 Marion Anderson Noyes was one of the few American women of the twentieth century to have a long and active career as a professional metalsmith. Beginning in the late 1930s, she designed both modernist flatware and hollowware for major firms including Reed & Barton and Towle. She also occasionally fashioned handmade jewelry such as the three closely related brooches seen here. The simple stylized interpretation of nature reflects earlier twentieth-century jewelry design, especially from Vienna.

 The Tetela and the Songye are closely related groups who make figures for personal religious rituals. Carving styles and materials for these figures are as diverse as their individual functions. A figure may be used to cure illness, bring wealth, or ensure good hunting. This figure includes fur wrapped tightly around its body and a horn from an antelope projecting from its head.

 The Luba believe that twins, called "children of the moon," have supernatural powers and can be the harbingers of both good and evil. Twins must be honored and appeased through songs, prayers, blessings, and gifts made each month on the night of a new moon. Figures like this commemorate the spirit of a twin, and the insertion of an iron pin in the top of the head is intended to contain and channel the spirit within.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 Kwahu, or Eagle Dancer, usually appears in a troupe of several dancers, spreading feathered wings and squawking and imitating eagle behavior while the Koyemshi (Mudhead Kachinas) sing to him. The sponsoring kiva—a men’s society that holds its meetings in sacred underground spaces—must fast and abstain from sexual relations for a period before the dance. The Eagle Dance is a prayer for good crops, rain, and plentiful eagle feathers. Because the eagle is considered sacred, its feathers are important in many ceremonies. Kwahu, o Bailarín Aguila, usualmente aparece con una tropa de varios danzantes, extendiendo sus alas emplumadas y graznando e imitando la conducta de las águilas mientras los Koyemshi (Kachinas Cabeza de Barro) le cantan. La kiva auspiciadora – sociedad masculina que se reúne en espacios sagrados subterráneos—debe ayunar y abstenerse de relaciones sexuales por un cierto periodo antes de la danza. La Danza Aguila es una plegaria para recibir buenas cosechas, lluvia y abundancia de plumas de águila. Al ser el águila considerada sagrada, sus plumas son importantes en muchas ceremonias.
 Sidney Kerner joined the Photo League, a cooperative of New York photographers committed to socially conscious images, in 1937, when he was just seventeen years old. The following year, he captured the harsh realities of life during the Great Depression in this image taken at Coney Island. The economic hardship reflected in the girl’s tattered and ill-fitting clothing is paralleled by the run-down nature of her surroundings.
 In Ghana and the Ivory Coast, regions that acquired great wealth from the mining and trading of gold, rulers displayed their status by wearing a profusion of gold ornaments, even attaching such objects to umbrellas and swords. Although many of these ornaments are abstract geometric shapes, some represent human faces or animals. Such works were made using the lost-wax casting method, in which a clay mold was made around a modeled wax form. The mold was then heated and the wax poured out, after which molten gold was poured in and solidified in the form of the original wax model.
 ART OF INNOVATIONThese three works speak to the highly inventive history of Yoruba art. Incorporating outside materials, they each reflect how both a colonial past and global exchange shaped shifting ideas about local identity. Even this bead-embroidered crown, the ultimate symbol of Yoruba kingship, is the product of a complex global story. Although the Yoruba have a long history of glassmaking, the large, multicolored ade crown depicts figures wearing bowler hats and contains beads imported by the British in the late nineteenth century into what would soon become the Nigeria colony. The smaller beaded crown, known as an oríkògbòfó, is an evolution of the ade form, but it is modeled after the wig of a British barrister (lawyer), still worn in court today by members of the Nigerian judiciary. Yinka Shonibare, a British artist of Yoruba and Nigerian descent, used Dutch wax-printed fabric to create Skipping Girl. This material—a commodity associated with Africa but actually created in Europe, based on Indonesian designs, and sold in West Africa—serves as a symbol of the web of economic and cultural interrelationships among Africa, Asia, and Europe. Shonibare exposes cultural "authenticity" as an illusion and evokes the layers of historical connections among global cultures.
 A Sufi’s attributes and clothing indicate the mystical order to which he or she belongs and may also suggest rank and status within that order. Here, the patriarch’s black robe emphasizes his authority. The varied styles of the hats further delineate positions within the group. The central seated figure holds a tabar, a small ceremonial axe, while each of the remaining men holds a walking staff, another iconic Sufi attribute. The extremely long beards of the male members identify this group as part of the Ahl-i Haqq order of Sufis, whose practices are guarded with extreme secrecy. The portrait may have been taken by Antoin Sevruguin, who served at the court of the Qajar ruler Nasir al-Din Shah in the latter nineteenth century and is known for his photographs of Iranian landscapes and subjects.
 
 Just before moving to New Mexico permanently in 1949, O’Keeffe painted this farewell salute to New York, her home for thirty years. The Brooklyn Bridge was an iconic subject for her generation of modern artists, but she had never painted it before. She used the twin arches and harp-like cables of the bridge to create a valentine to the things she was leaving behind, saying goodbye to Stieglitz, their partnership, and the city where they launched their careers. The bridge is also a gateway, perhaps her metaphor for leaving the manmade city of stone and steel for the clear blue skies of New Mexico.
 In 1916 and 1917 Matisse devoted several small paintings to an Italian model named Laurette, whom he consistently posed in a pink armchair and green robe. This example is a study in sinuous curves—from the model’s long, dark hair to the black contours describing the fall of her robe to the wood frame of the chair. Although Laurette looks out of the picture plane in the direction of the viewer, her expression seems distant, unfocused, and meditative. Matisse has incised his signature in the upper right corner of the work, most likely using the handle of his brush.
Kate Gilmore sets up scenarios in which she performs tasks that test her physical endurance, such as breaking out of confining spaces, scaling high walls, or moving heavy objects. These feats are at once potentially dangerous and seemingly meaningless, yet the artist enacts them repeatedly with unwavering determination and focus. Gilmore originally executed and recorded Blood from a Stone in the Museum’s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art before the work appeared in the 2009–10 exhibition Reflections on the Electric Mirror: New Feminist Video.
 This image shows the rooms that were the elegant Detroit executive offices of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, in the 1910s and 1920s. The wood paneling has lost its luster, and a lush carpet of brilliant green moss now covers the floor. The decrepit state of Ford’s office—a contemporary ruin of a glorious, not too distant past—becomes a metaphor not only for the fate of the automobile industry or of this once wealthy and important Midwestern city, but also for the deindustrialization of America.
 ART OF TRAUMABoth of these very different Congolese works are deeply emotional expressions. One was commissioned to resolve a personal trauma, while the other represents a viscerally remembered social upheaval from the colonial era. Figures like this mother and child were believed to offer protection, through the intervention of spirits, by the Bwanga Bwa Cibola society. When a woman lost successive children through miscarriages or early infant death, she could be initiated into the society to protect herself from ominous forces suspected to be the cause of the deaths. This emotionally gripping figure is considered to be one of the great masterpieces of African art. Tshibumba's painting depicts the slaughter of striking mineworkers in Lubumbashi at the order of the Belgian colonial government on December 9, 1941. The artist critiques the institutions complicit in the colonial system: Belgium (represented by the flag), the church, the mining company, the colonial governor (with arm raised), and the Congolese soldiers in the colonial army. Following independence in 1960, a market for narrative painting developed among urban Congolese who were working in mining factories and living in new, Western-style homes.
 Since the 1960s Philip Pearlstein has been making paintings of human bodies posed in interior spaces. The bodies are arranged casually, usually cropped (often at the head), and the harsh, cool light reveals the surfaces and hollows of the flesh. This intense realism recalls the view through a photographic lens.
 Through her photographs, Cass Bird asserts the positive existence of people who push the perceived boundaries of gender. In this way she suggests a world that is Whitmanesque in rejecting society’s restrictions. In this photograph, taken on a rooftop in Brooklyn, Bird’s friend Macaulay stares out from under a cap emblazoned with the words “I Look Just Like My Daddy.” Macaulay’s gender is ambiguous. Her cap’s proclamation is likewise ambiguous—perhaps it is true, or perhaps it is an ironic statement of an expectation that will never be realized.
 The street artist Swoon’s ethereal installation juxtaposes five portraits with the Cyclone, one of the last existing wooden roller coasters. As if it were seen in their dreams, the Cyclone’s lace-like structure acquires a gossamer quality. Given Swoon’s fascination with Coney Island’s ceaseless potential for magic and mystery, her three-dimensional dreamscape may represent a cautiously optimistic belief in the site’s continual rebirth.
 Throughout her long and prolific career Niki de Saint Phalle, a former cover model for Life magazine and French Vogue, investigated feminine archetypes and women’s societal roles. Her Nanas, bold, sexy sculptures of the proverbial everywoman, are playful and empowering, while the whimsical lithographs My Love We Won’t and Dear Diana offer humorous takes on girlhood obsessions. The savvy My Heart Belongs to Marcel pays homage not to Daddy (as in the popular song), but to Marcel Duchamp, the influential Dada artist and a personal friend.

 The Empty City: Fragrant Creek is from a series that comments on the fate of the cities, towns, and villages along the Yangtze River that were evacuated ahead of the flooding expected from the Three Gorges Dam in China. The main subject here is the river itself, meandering through the entire image. On its banks, caught amid tangled vegetation, are the remains of former human habitation; we are witnessing the brutal results of forced displacement. Eventually, the coming flood will submerge this scene.Despite the highly contemporary references, the artist has chosen to use traditional Chinese techniques and visual symbolism. He uses layered mulberry paper, applying ink, watercolor, and mineral pigments, and often distresses the paper by overworking it.
 Hairstyles are often complex signifiers of identity and social status, particularly for the Yoruba people. They can indicate a woman’s age, her occupation, and, in some contexts, her religious or political power. Many hairdos are also tied to specific ceremonies, such as a wedding or the naming ceremony of a child. Working over three decades, J. D. ’Okhai Ojeikere undertook a photographic series systematically documenting the rich variety of Nigerian hairstyles. He sought to capture the diversity and beauty of the hairdos he witnessed in the streets of cities and villages, in marketplaces and offices, and at parties, celebrations, and festivals around the country. Most of the photographs, like Fro Fro and Suku Sinero Kiko, were taken from behind, revealing and emphasizing the abstract and sculptural aspects of the hairdos.

 In a thirty-year photographic project, Ojeikere sought to systematically document the rich variety and beauty of the contemporary Nigerian hairstyles he witnessed in daily life. Most of the photographs, like Abebe, were taken from behind, revealing the abstract and sculptural aspects of the hairdos.Hairstyles are often complex signifiers of identity and social status, particularly for the Yoruba. They can indicate a woman’s age, her occupation, her religious or political power, or even her state of mind. Many hairdos are also tied to specific ceremonies, such as a wedding or the naming ceremony of a child. The abebe (fan) style shown here has an implication of “coolness,” composure, and royalty, qualities that are ideally linked.
 In her Waterfall series, Pat Steir has explored the imagery of water, continuing her fascination with landscape. This work, which verges on abstraction, is nevertheless an evocative representation of a waterfall. The artist applied a number of horizontal brushstrokes loaded with thinned paint at the top of the canvas, and the paint streamed down in lines, drips, and rivulets, emulating the properties of water.
 When I'm doing my pottery I think of Mom [Marie Z. Chino] first, and that she could help me. I want to do like she does. She didn't need outlining, she just painted, and sometimes I do that now I know the design and I just do it.-Grace Chino, quoted in Rick Dillingham, Fourteen Families in Pueblo Pottery (1994)The Chino family, led by the matriarch Marie Z. Chino, was innovative in adapting the designs found on prehistoric pottery shards to modern pottery forms. Grace Chino here used a dazzling, closely lined black-and-white design on a new vessel form reminiscent of ancient Pueblo pots. The result is a form of abstraction that embraces tradition as essential to innovation.
 Melvin Edwards’s weighty sculptures combine nails, tools, gears, and other metal objects to create abstract compositions. This work belongs to his extensive Lynch Fragment series, begun in the 1960s and inspired by Ralph Ginzburg’s 100 Years of Lynching (1962), a collection of newspaper reports of lynchings published to commemorate the centennial of the Civil War. The Lynch Fragment sculptures evoke this history of violence through their jarring juxtaposition of forms and rough welding. Takawira–J, a later work from the series, was made while Edwards was teaching in Zimbabwe and was named for John Takawira, a sculptor he met there.
 My grandmother braided my hair as she did when I was a child, with pigtails, barrettes, and ribbons. It was her way of adorning me as her champion porcelain doll. This image captures a rare moment where she wanted to make a portrait of me with her and her dolls. I set up one light and ran a cable release behind my back. There was nobody present but Grandma Ruby and me. We both quietly sat up and looked over our shoulders into the lens. I pressed the cable release, and the shutter clicked for nearly one second. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Valerie Hegarty’s Fallen Bierstadt is inspired by the work of the renowned nineteenth-century American landscape painter Albert Bierstadt (whose monumental A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie hangs to the right). Hegarty was drawn to the way nineteenth-century landscape artists depicted vast expanses of wilderness as an expression of “Manifest Destiny,” the notion that the United States was divinely entitled to expand across the entire North American continent. In Fallen Bierstadt the “canvas” appears to decay, as if affected by the ravages of nature. The title seems to refer both to the physical appearance of the piece and to the end of a heroic tradition of landscape painting.
 Liu Dan received his early education from his grandfather. Following the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), he entered the Jiangsu Chinese Painting Institute to gain formal training. Meticulous brushwork and subtle gradations in ink tones are hallmarks of his painting style.This monumental painting depicts a Taihu rock, or spirit stone, a variety of limestone appreciated by Chinese connoisseurs for the way it suggests a landscape in miniature. The rock's combination of abstract forms and voided space also recalls Chinese calligraphy. These stones were often installed in gardens or on the desks of scholars as focal points for meditation. In the hands of a contemporary artist, the traditional Taihu rock form becomes a modernist abstraction.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 John I. H. Baur, head of the Brooklyn Museum’s Department of Painting and Sculpture from 1936 to 1952, here appears seated in an interior space, perhaps his office. His body, cropped at the head and ankle, fills the frame. Alice Neel captured idiosyncrasies such as his lightly rumpled suit, wrinkled face, and veiny hands. One of her guiding principles as a portraitist was, in her words, that “every person is a new universe unique with its own laws.”
 Unlike the majority of American painters who were engaged with gestural abstraction at mid-century, Hale Woodruff remained rooted in an artistic process that originated with traditional notions of subject matter. A leading African American artist of the period, Woodruff had devoted his energies emphatically to subjects relevant to the black experience and the civil rights effort beginning in the 1930s. After his move to New York in 1946 and a decisive turn to abstraction, he executed numerous landscapes such as this one, in which the forms are intended to convey the character of a particular place and time of day.
 Gowanus Canal from 2nd Street is a meticulously executed image of an old Brooklyn industrial waterway. Amid the abundant vegetation, figures equipped with long poles search for something in the murky water. The large warehouse in the middle of this carefully balance composition seems to be abandoned. Car tires, wrecked buses, and cars on the right slowly change into the jagged outline of a cityscape in the background. The canal's still waters are embellished by the reflections of its environs. There is an inherent beauty in this melancholic scene. We begin to understand the attraction this human-made waterway has for Brooklyn residents. At present, the cleanup of the Gowanus Canal and plans for its recreational use are under way.
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.

 Elsa Rady’s porcelain vessels merge Asian ceramic tradition with the simplicity of modern European and American design. In the course of her career, Rady began to focus on the sculptural aspects of her work rather than the utilitarian features usually associated with the vessel form. In 1990 she began to assemble her pieces in groups of various sizes. The works of her Still Life series are tableaux in which the individual pieces relate to each other very much as objects in traditional still-life paintings do. In Still Life IV two distinctly different vessels are paired on an aluminum shelf that is attached to a rectangular backdrop, which suggests the clearly defined pictorial plane of a painting.
 Growing up on the urban terrain of concrete sidewalks, Brooklyn children and teenagers have long embraced skating as a pastime. In 1950 N. Jay Jaffee photographed a young skater as she extended her arm out to gain balance independent of her father’s hold. Vincent Cianni’s 1995 image captures a graceful moment of a teenage boy midair. The backgrounds of these images reveal changing textures of the neighborhood landscapes: felt hats with fur trim and arched glass storefront windows in the former, and baggy T-shirts and graffiti scrawled along a block in the latter. Although taken forty-five years apart, these photographs display skating as a communal and enjoyed act for Brooklyn youth.
 Originally built for the 1939 New York World’s Fair, the Parachute Jump has been a Coney Island landmark since 1941. Stephen Salmieri photographed the structure seven years after the ride ceased operating, when urban decline resulted in a vastly changed landscape.
 
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”

 Pretend #2 is constructed from three images of women with their young children. As in most of her work, both as a philosopher and as an artist, Adrian Piper addresses the social and economic imbalance of our world and the issue of racism. In the central image a Caucasian mother smiles proudly, looking straight into the camera. She seems unaware of the anguish of the African mother at the left or the Asian mother at the right. The silkscreened text across the bottom, “Pretend not to know what you know,” connects the three images and forces the viewer to contemplate the frequent denials we choose to make to lessen the pangs of conscience.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 Japanese pottery has always been closely associated with the tea ceremony. From ancient times the great Japanese tea masters used ceramic utensils to reflect their own ideas and style. One example is Oribe ware, named for the tea master Furuta Oribe (1544â1615). Oribe ceramics are distinguished by warped forms and bold pictorial patternsâa departure from earlier symmetrical designs. The Oribe tradition continues to the present, as indicated by the work of Takiguchi Kiheiji shown here.
 Blinds relates to Mary Heilmann’s so-called Jealousy Paintings, a series of abstract works initiated in the 1970s that was inspired by details of the artist’s immediate surroundings, such as air vents, French doors, and window blinds. The name of the series is a play on jalousie, a colloquial French word for window louvers or blinds, and a nod to the novel La Jalousie, by one of the artist’s favorite authors, Alain Robbe-Grillet. Blinds playfully questions the Renaissance concept of paintings as windows that offer a glimpse of other worlds, contiguous with ours. With its edges brushed gold to simulate a picture frame or, even, a window frame, Blinds nevertheless asserts its identity as a planar object.
 May Stevens has been a committed political activist throughout her long career. Her Big Daddy series began in response to her disappointment and anger over the Vietnam War. For Stevens, Big Daddy takes on aspects of both the personal and the political. Based on a portrait of her resolutely patriotic father, the obviously male figure is also reminiscent of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919). Here, the figure’s bullet-shaped head exaggerates his phallic power and capacity for violence. However, by depicting him as a paper doll, to be dressed up as an executioner, decorated soldier, policeman, or butcher, Stevens ultimately strips Big Daddy of his patriarchal command.
 Fernando Mastrangelo appropriates one of Mexico’s national symbols, the Aztec Calendar Stone, which dates from about 1500 and symbolizes the creation of the Aztec universe. Retaining the central skeletal face of Tonatiuh, the Sun God, Mastrangelo fills the surrounding areas with contemporary consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, candy, sparkplugs, and toothpaste.The depiction of corn-based products draws attention to Mexico’s mass cultivation of corn to meet energy needs (via ethanol) and foreign consumer demands. At the same time, an iconic Aztec image suggests parallels between the conquest of Mexico by the Spanish, centuries ago, and the present-day exploitation of local Mexican corn production by North American agribusiness.
 In Blossom, a piano inexplicably fused with a tree plays "Strange Fruit" (in an arrangement by the artist). The song, popularized in the 1930s by Billie Holiday, protests the atrocity of lynching: "Southern trees bear a strange fruit, / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root, / Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze, / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees." The haunting lyrics suggest that the fused piano may be read as a surrogate for a violated human body.Influenced by a 2006 incident in Jena, Louisiana, in which nooses were dangled from a tree at a racially troubled high school, the piece also evokes the rich cross-cultural symbolism of trees: Biggers alludes to the story of Buddha finding enlightenment under a bodhi tree. This unlikely combination demonstrates his interest in multiplicities of both inspiration and interpretation.
 Born features a theme that has prevailed in Kiki Smith’s work for years—the relationship between animals, particularly wolves, and humans. This image subverts the story line of one of the world’s best-known fairy tales by imagining Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother as born of the wolf rather than eaten by him.
 
 Betty Woodman is one of the preeminent ceramic artists working today. In her pieces she combines traditional techniques and materials with her own innovations, constantly crossing the boundaries between fine arts and crafts to extend the possibilities of ceramics. Still-Life Vase #10, from a series begun in 1990, displays the boldness of this artist’s approach. A fully developed large vase is the core of the piece, but its form gets almost obliterated by the dramatically painted surface. Large protruding wings, or handles, attached at the sides are themselves shaped as incomplete, flat vessels adorned with handles and other protrusions. Thus, the piece presents an arrangement of objects in space, a fundamental feature of the still-life genre in visual art.
 Polly Apfelbaum’s The Dwarves without Snow White demonstrates the artist’s interest in expanding the accustomed boundaries of painting. Apfelbaum paints with dyes on rectangles of crushed velvet that are then folded, showing the underlying layers of colors, and placed on cardboard boxes. The boxes function as pedestals for the painted velvet, integrating painting and sculpture in a single work. According to Apfelbaum, the box is a metaphor for the artist’s paint box as well as for the painted wedding chest, which historically held the trousseau that defined a woman’s standing in society. The title refers to the well-known fairy tale and its ideals of femininity.
 In the ongoing series Sunday Paintings, Byron Kim inscribes personal notes about his daily life onto his painted images of the sky. In nuanced hues of blue, each of the six examples shown here represents the sky on the Sunday it was painted. The words sit on the picture plane, creating a play between the painting as a flat surface and as a window opening onto the illusion of deep space. Lined up on a wall, the Sunday Paintings have a cinematic quality: each panel looks like a frame in a film sequence—a moment in time stilled—as if each is a part of a larger ongoing whole. While the works were created on Sundays, the title of this series also refers to amateurs known as “Sunday painters,” admired by Kim for the purity of their motives in making art.
 In his painting, Mark Bradford, a Los Angeles-based artist, incorporates the materials of his other profession, as a hair stylist, into his paintings. Blending the tools of the African American beauty trade with the more traditional medium of paint on canvas, Bradford crafts works that comment on both aesthetic and cultural phenomena. Pairing a "high art" medium with objects from daily life enables the artist to create subtle works that demonstrate his passion for issues of race, class, gender, and art-world politics.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Corot builds the gently sloping silhouette of the mountain range with thin, transparent films of brown, gray, and blue paint in broad, visible brushstrokes. For the sky, he matches thick layers of blue, gray, and white pigment with expanses of paper prepared with a light base or ground coat of paint. Corot endows the stand of firs in the foreground with an unexpected calligraphic flatness and reduces the tree trunks to stems. His passion for painting out-of-doors in front of the subject—notably on three visits to Italy and several trips around France—earned him the reverence of subsequent generations of landscape painters, particularly the Impressionists.
 Here, Stephen Salmieri focuses on a balloon-toss worker at Coney Island whose down-turned teased hairstyle resembles the inflated balloons in the background. By isolating the subject and cropping out the surrounding amusement park activity, he establishes a sense of intimacy, as though the viewer could be next in line to play the game.
 Teri Greeves created this piece by hand-sewing beads, Swarovski crystals, silver conchos, and spiny-oyster shell cabochons on a pair of high-heeled tennis shoes designed by Steve Madden. The inner panels are inspired by Great Lakes tribes’ floral designs. The outside panels depict contemporary jingle dress dancers swaying to the drumming during a powwow. Each woman depicted on the shoes wears full regalia, including a beaded dress, moccasins, and a belt with real silver conchos. Greeves’s detailed beadwork melds traditional technique with modern fashion in a lively contemporary tour de force.
 Regional Work #2 is from a series of diptychs called Regional Pieces done by the artist in 1976. Here one panel depicts a seascape of dark purples, and the other a fish immersed in the same purple waters. Each panel is framed by drapery made of brightly painted Celastic, a clothlike material, giving the impression of viewing the image through a window (one above the sea line and the other below, looking directly into the ocean). Writing about her work, Morton referred to “the responsibility of the artist . . . to be free, and while in that freedom, to look, and to see while looking, and to feel, and to respond while feeling, and to be romantic, and to love the romance.”
 ART OF CREATIONWhile these works appear quite different on the surface, both are made from the same material, terracotta. They were also created through very similar techniques, in which the artist built up the form from thin coils of clay to produce a hollow vessel that could be further sculpted and fired. The head from the Nok culture is an archaeological fragment, possibly once part of a full figure. One of the oldest pieces in the African collection, it was found at one of the earliest known iron-smelting sites in Africa. Magdalene Odundo, a contemporary artist drawing on the global history of pottery, used an understated anthropomorphic vocabulary to create this abstract, burnished vessel that evokes the female form. Odundo achieved the black, smoky finish by covering her pots with a clay slip and firing them in a closed kiln with combustible materials such as wood chips. Since pottery has long been associated with women’s work across the African continent, some scholars have speculated that female artists created the ancient Nok statuary. It is thus possible that the two works displayed here—among the African collection's oldest and newest, respectively—may both be by women artists.
 Part of a series that features lengths of decommissioned fire hoses, In Case of Race Riot II exemplifies Theaster Gates’s practice of civic responsibility and social engagement. The work alludes to the Civil Rights Movement and, in particular, the use of high-pressure water hoses on peaceful African American demonstrators in Birmingham, Alabama, in May 1963. However, the possibility of future use of the fire hose, as suggested by the title, questions an easy acceptance of this tumultuous era of American history and points to the ongoing struggles for African Americans’ civil rights.
 Thomas E. Warren’s “Centripetal Spring” chair is the forerunner of Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf’s Aeron chair, designed nearly 150 years later. Both are made principally of metal, raised on casters for mobility, rotate on a central column, and allow for adjustment of the angle of the seat. The very different look of the chairs suggests the ways that consumer attitudes toward industrial invention and modernity have evolved over the centuries. Although Warren’s chair bears a patent mark (on the bottom of the seat), he felt the need to mitigate the newness of his invention by concealing its ingenious metal spring system beneath a dense, soft curtain of luxurious passementerie (elaborate trim). Similarly, he disguised his progressive use of cast iron for the frame by rendering it in the backward-looking Rococo Revival style and gilding it. In contrast, the makers of the Aeron chair reveal its mechanical elements, celebrate its recycled man-made materials, and use a monochromatic black to underline the seriousness of the design, all without fear of losing customers.
 
 Harry Lapow began frequenting Coney Island to capture quirks of the beach and boardwalk after receiving a Ciroflex camera on his forty-third birthday. He was intrigued by the camera’s ability to isolate details and fleeting moments of everyday life. Here, a toddler’s crossed legs appear above the head of a buried woman whose eyes are covered by a floral towel. In cropping this beach sighting, Lapow crafts a surprising juxtaposition, forming an unlikely dynamic between the lively child and the masked adult.
 In 1967, Richard Diebenkorn began a series of paintings named Ocean Park after the section of Santa Monica, California, where he had his studio. In contrast to his preceding, figurative group of works, this new series of abstract images allowed the artist to employ, as he put it, "an allover light which wasn't possible in the representational works, which seem somewhat dingy by comparison." In Ocean Park No.27, Diebenkorn reduces the scene to planes and fragments of color. Depth and spatial illusion are suggested by the color's changing density and the composition's system of receding lines. Using a low-key palette devoid of harsh tones, the artist accomplishes his stated goal of communicating "a feeling of strength in reserve, tension beneath calm."
 This powerful commentary on the history of war and race in America is from a series of nine mixed-media collages that the artist Joyce Kozloff calls “a kind of personal, quirky history of America.” The current invasion of Iraq was the emotional catalyst for this work, which portrays a trail of geopolitical conflicts. This piece, the fifth in the series, is composed of appropriated imagery, including musical notes and song lyrics taken from 1920s game boards given to the artist by her mother. It depicts laboring slaves as well as Civil War soldiers, languid antebellum women, cotton fields, steamships, trains, churches, and other period structures. Words from slave songs and Bible hymns, and texts about “The War of Independence,” the Mason and Dixon Line, and Gettysburg are dispersed throughout the work.
 
 ART OF HISTORYHistory is about power, and its depiction is a consequential act. These two works—a technically refined casting of precious materials for a powerful monarch, and a group of movable wood figures celebrating a new democratic era—commemorate specific important moments in the political histories of their respective societies. The Edo figure glorifies the spirit of a deceased king, or oba, who ruled the kingdom of Benin at the height of its power. A motif on the figure's kilt depicting an elephant, whose trunk ends in a human right hand, identifies this work with the reign of the oba Esigie, who ruled from 1504 to 1550. Johannes Segogela's sculpture addresses the South African transition from the armed liberation struggle against whites-only apartheid rule into the new democratic era, born the following year with the multiracial elections that swept Nelson Mandela to power. The work suggests the need for South Africans to cast their weapons into the furnace.
 This photograph from early in Cindy Sherman’s artistic career indicates a burgeoning interest in what has become a lifelong investigation into using herself as subject. Produced in 1975, during her time as an art student at the State University of New York, Buffalo, the work prefigures her famous Untitled Film Stills series by two years. In it, the artist references Claude Cahun, an early Surrealist photographer whose androgynous self-portraits inspired a later generation of feminist theorists to think about gender as a social role that is performed rather than innate—ideas that would become central to Sherman’s oeuvre from the mid-1970s onward.
 A modern-day coat of arms assembled from images of luxury consumer items, this collage could be regarded as a catalogue of status symbols coveted by contemporary celebrities. Within the traditional heraldic format, the central image of rapper LL Cool J is flanked by large gold Rolex watches. Inspired by coats of arms on the facades of historical European buildings, Rashaad Newsome brings this tradition, which originated in the mid-twelfth century, into the present.
 The Coney Island Polar Bear Club, the earliest organization of its kind, was founded in 1903 by Bernarr Macfadden, known as the “Father of Physical Culture.” An early advocate for outdoor exercise, Macfadden believed that taking a dip in the ocean during the winter could restore one’s immunity and stamina. Here, members of the Polar Bear Club pose on the beach on a snowy winter day.
 While spiders may be threatening creatures to many people, for Louise Bourgeois they represent a nurturing quality that she associates with her mother. In a maternal fashion, the spider weaves a perfect web that serves as a protective barrier and provides food. For Bourgeois, the spider also suggests the patience and industriousness that served her mother well as a skilled weaver in the family business of tapestry restoration. Thus, the image of the spider is capable of evoking both threat and tenderness; such a meeting of supposed opposites or a reconciliation of conflicting or even contradictory states is one of the most characteristic features of Louise Bourgeois’s art.
This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 Jean-Michel Othoniel has transformed this utilitarian vehicle—a nineteenth-century covered wagon known as a prairie schooner—into an elegant object of beauty by remaking its canvas cover with panes of blown glass and adding swags and finials composed of oversized glass beads.The artist, who favors alterable materials, began working with sulfur and wax and since 1993 has also experimented with the possibilities presented by glass. The potential for transformation that occurs with this material is echoed here by themes of migration and social change suggested by the covered wagon, part of the collective memory and mythology of American culture.
 Sol LeWitt was a mentor to many younger artists and writers. He was so significant to Lippard’s thinking that she dedicated Six Years to him. While his own practice always led to materialized works, he defined his artistic method as Conceptual, because he would always start from an idea, often permutations of a basic form or repetition of an operation, which he called the “machine that makes the art.” These two sketches show him elaborating the multiple forms of open cubes, and some of the various configurations possible for parallel straight lines.
 Though Kehinde Wiley is best known for his painted portraits, here he shifts from painting to sculpture. In both the lift and turn of the young man’s head and the open V of his zippered collar, this bronze refers to an eighteenth-century marble bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon (see illustration).Yet in many other ways, Wiley’s work could hardly be more different: in substituting male for female, black for white, and present for past, he upends the earlier sculpture even as he quotes it. His radical reinterpretation encourages us to examine the stereotypes that can be found in portraiture.—Rujeko Hockley, Assistant Curator, Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum
 Ellen Lesperance creates knitting patterns based on examples of sweaters she finds in archival photographs of female activists, and then uses these pattern paintings as guides for her hand-knit “historic” sweaters. The neatly lettered title on this painting links it to direct action and political resistance, tracing the radical history of women imprisoned for spearheading antinuclear encampments in the 1980s. Displayed together, Lesperance’s painting and sweater engage this activist history, literally and metaphorically offering a pattern for a new generation.
 Judy Chicago created this test plate for her room-size installation The Dinner Party (on permanent view on the fourth floor of the Museum), a milestone in twentieth-century art. The installation is composed of a banquet arranged on a triangular table with thirty-nine place settings, each commemorating an important woman from history.Dedicated to the black abolitionist and feminist Sojourner Truth (1797–1883), this plate depicts weeping for the suffering of the slaves, a mask concealing the real self, and a fist raised in rage and defiance.
 Geometric and spare, Clay Ketter’s R.T.P.18.B is part of his Renovation Trace Paintings series, initiated in 1995. Constructed out of common building materials including wallboard, paint, and joint compound, this large panel resembles an actual section of a wall with a doorway flanked by cupboards. The image is enigmatic, in a number of ways: The wall could be in the process of either construction or demolition, the place either real or imaginary. Moreover, the muted tones and streamlined aesthetic recall both Bauhaus design and Minimalist sculpture. And, as both object and image, R.T.P.18.B straddles the categories of sculpture and painting. Whatever the object’s significance, the artist’s experience as a carpenter informs the subject and materials of his work.

 Anna Williams, an African American quilt-maker born and raised near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, made quilts throughout her life, incorporating scraps of traditional printed cottons, unusual synthetics, and woven or decorated fabrics such as the sequined pieces seen here. The artist’s bold approach combines traditional block settings with free-flowing improvisation and a masterful use of color. In the late 1980s, Williams’s unique style of quilt-making was recognized by artists and collectors, who encouraged her to exhibit and sell her work.
 Through the Large Glass documents one of Wilke’s most effective and well-known performances, in which she executed a languid striptease behind the cracked transparent surface of Marcel Duchamp’s famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass), 1915–23, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1976. Dressed in a fedora and a man’s white satin suit, she strikes a series of poses evoking the style of 1970s fashion photography and then strips, cleverly suggesting bride and bachelor simultaneously. In her self-conscious affectation of a fashion model, Wilke willfully uses her own image and her sexuality to confront the erotic representation of women in art history and popular culture.
 
 Nayland Blake is known for work that emphasizes issues of race and sexuality. He explores the complexity of racial and sexual identity and social prejudice, using the image of the rabbit to refer to not only gay sexuality and African American heritage but individual freedom from society’s classifications. In 2000 he stated, “I’m using the rabbit as this metaphor for something that’s sort of in-between race. Of indeterminate race. That came from thinking about Br’er Rabbit. . . . Those stories are West African folktales that came into this country with slaves. They’re like the progenitor of Bugs Bunny. So in thinking about my own racial identity, I kept sort of using this rabbit metaphor.”
 In the Quechua-speaking community of Chinchero, men and women wear distinctive garments that identify them by gender and community. Large garments such as this shawl are woven in two parts—symmetrical opposites that are sewn together. Wide blue bands called pampakuna, or fields, are set apart by multi-striped panels filled with colorful geometric designs. Shawls with indigo-blue fields are characteristic of Chinchero women's garments.
 Petah Coyne’s fantastical forms, presenting a beauty that slides into the grotesque, allude to death and decay. Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculpturesproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works—the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.Coyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.
 This work was inspired by Mickalene Thomas’s 2011 residency at the house and gardens of the French Impressionist painter Claude Monet (1840–1926) in Giverny, France (see illustration). Thomas responded strongly to the colors Monet selected for the rooms of his house, the collection of art that hung on the walls, and the views of the garden that were deliberately framed by the windows. The Giverny residency coincided with her adoption of interiors and landscape as motifs in her own work.
 As suggested by her assumed name, the artist known as Swoon is an admirer of urban art like that featured in the special exhibition Graffiti, on view elsewhere on this floor. Trained in printmaking in Prague and at Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute, she decided to take her own art to the streets in l999, pasting her large linoleum- and woodcuts, printed on thin paper, on the sides of the industrial buildings of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side.The artist’s main subjects are the people of the city, often her family members and friends but also strangers. “I go and look at people hanging out on the street,” she says. “So what I wind up with is actually a street scene—a portrait of the city.”Recently, Swoon has begun creating large, intricate installations in which layers of printed and cutout material projecting into space are supplemented by objects found in the street. Brooklyn Museum Installation is a site-specific work based on a 2003 piece called Coney Island Cyclone, after the landmark Brooklyn roller coaster. The artist translates the coaster’s image into an intricate web of printed fragments. The lacelike appearance reveals influences as various as Indonesian shadow puppets and the printing methods of German Expressionism.The artist’s attraction to Coney Island derives from an all-American fascination with this place of wonder, magic, and bizarre personages. For Swoon, who was born in Florida, Coney Island encapsulates New York and its never-ending surprises, possibilities, and mystery.

 This tapered water jar with a highly polished black surface has a bear-paw motif on its neck. Alluding to the Santa Clara legend of a bear that led people to water in a time of drought, the bear paw is placed upright, as if in prayer asking for rain and everlasting life. The bands around the jar, referred to as rainbows, are also considered prayers, to keep the water from evaporating. According to Margaret Tafoya, the bear paw and rainbow designs are gifts from her Santa Clara ancestors. Esta jarra alargada de superficie negra bruñida tiene un motivo de garra de oso en el cuello. Aludiendo a la leyenda Santa Clara en la cual un oso condujo a la gente al agua en tiempo de sequía, la garra de oso está colocada hacia arriba, como en una plegaria pidiendo lluvia y vida eterna. Las franjas alrededor de la jarra, semejando un arcoíris, también se consideran plegarias, para prevenir que se evapore el agua. De acuerdo con Margaret Tafoya, los diseños de garra de oso y el arcoíris son regalos de sus ancestros Santa Clara.
 Yoram Wolberger’s sculpture of a Native American warrior belongs to a series of monumental versions of the plastic toy figurines that the artist used to stage elaborate mock battles between cowboys and Indians during his youth. Though infused with nostalgia, Red Indian #4 also invokes the violence that permeates both popular childhood games and the history of indigenous peoples in North America. To create his sculpture, Wolberger took molds of toy figurines—objects that were themselves based on stock images of Native Americans in nineteenth-century landscape paintings of America’s wilderness. Such imagery helped to foster perceptions among non-Natives of Indians as uncivilized, hostile, and an impediment to national progress defined by westward expansion. The irregular “fins” around the edges of Wolberger’s sculpture, which mimic the seams of their mass-produced toy counterparts, symbolize the continuing proliferation of standardized images of Native Americans and the American frontier. Moreover, the lack of detail and the generic character of his warrior underscore the ways in which stereotypes deny historical circumstances and ignore the diversity of Native peoples.

 Damian Wampler’s series Darfur in Brooklyn, to which this image belongs, is an oblique portrait of a crisis. Brooklyn is home to more than three hundred Sudanese refugees, most of them living in the borough’s Kensington section, not far from Prospect Park. Through following one of them, the cab driver Omer Omar (shown here in his kitchen), for several months, Wampler presents a powerful portrait of the daily life of a little-known population in the Museum’s extended neighborhood.
 Arlene Shechet, a ceramicist and sculptor, also creates handmade papers from abacá, a plant native to the Philippines and prized for its delicate fibers. These works simultaneously make reference to the floor plans of Buddhist shrines, Japanese aizuri-e prints, and blue-and-white porcelain. The Flow Blue series, from which this work derives, is named after a particular type of British transfer pottery popular during the early nineteenth century. Modeled after Asian blue-and-white porcelain, these wares are known for their deliberately blurred forms mimicking the marbled appearance of lapis lazuli.

 Roxanne Swentzell’s work often plays on the interaction between native and non-native worlds. Here she uses clay, an ancient artistic medium, to depict a traditional Pueblo woman, whose face is much like Swentzell’s own. The woman in the sculpture looks up at the Santa Clara black pot balanced on her head, from which babies are emerging. But there is a contemporary ironic twist to what the woman is doing: is she “birthing” pots to be sold at an Indian market, or is it the baby Indians themselves that the consumer will want to buy? The work challenges the viewer to acknowledge the treatment of Native Americans as a stereotype and commodity in representations by non-natives in popular culture and advertising.
 Drawn to the creative energy of America’s ever-changing postwar city landscapes, the Athens-born Chryssa made a name for herself with work that utilized innovative materials taken from urban environments. During the 1960s she produced vibrant paintings, prints, and illuminated sculpture made of neon tubing, Plexiglas, and aluminum. The two sculptures shown here evoke Chryssa’s fascination with Times Square and celebrate the giant blinking, pulsing signs of the city. Her paintings and prints of the period, her Newspaper series of paintings in particular, are considered among the earliest Pop experiments with typography and print media.
 A play on geometric abstract painting, James Hyde’s piece utilizes everyday materials in place of pigment. The pairing of magenta and blue reflects the colors often found in the Madonna’s flowing gown as depicted in Renaissance altarpieces. The draped blue tarp could be seen as mimicking the way the fabric drapes around her feet.
 This photograph shows three women around a dining-room table, a symbol of a communal family ritual. But instead of facing each other, they are absorbed by their laptop computers. The women appear blurry and ghostlike, almost as if they have been transported to another world through the glowing screens. It is the inanimate physical objects throughout the room that come into view in detail, hinting at the transience of human existence as well as the sometimes alienating effects of contemporary communication. Pillsbury uses ambient lighting produced by the electronic devices that permeate our lives—such as televisions, computer screens, and cell phones—combined with long exposure times to create photographs that examine our relationships with these devices and the objects and people around us.
 Come Away from Her is based on a manuscript drawing by Lewis Carroll for his book Alice's Adventures Under Ground (1864). At this point in his story, friendly birds fly off when Alice talks about what her cat likes to eat. In Kiki Smith's prints based on fairytales, childhood vulnerability and innocence like Alice's can be imbued with a sense of the sexual awakening that accompanies adolescence, and the animals sometimes shown with young girls suggest underlying forces of nature. Here we witness a cryptic scene, as Alice watches winged forms, some of them with incongruous limbs, fly away from her.
 Dale Chihuly is the best-known glass artist in the United States. Trained at the University of Wisconsin and the Rhode Island School of Design, he received the first Fulbright Fellowship in glass and went to Venice in 1968 to study at Venini, the most progressive glass factory in Italy. In 1971 he established the Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle, the only American art school devoted entirely to glassmaking. His affinity for the Northwest is profound; he has strong ties to the landscape and great interest in the arts of the native peoples there. This particular work was inspired by the traditional woven baskets of the Haida and other Northwest Coast tribes.Chihuly has moved from small-scale vases of recognizable form to art that transcends the boundaries of traditional glassmaking. As this "basket" demonstrates, he has abandoned functionalism in favor of large sculptural forms. Often he and his assistants work on a grand scale, creating large environments composed of many thousands of glass elements for specific sites. In 1994, he created Brooklyn Wall, a temporary installation in the Museum's lobby.
 This blown-glass sculpture has a red and black design, the two signature colors for Northwest Coast art. It represents a killer whale, one of the crest designs of the Tlingit glass-blower Preston Singletary. The surface incorporates traditional form-line designs with the black outlining the positive, primary spaces and the deeply cut red shaping the negative, secondary spaces of the whale's body. This reflects the same style of design used in traditional mediums such as totem poles, Tlingit Chilkat blankets, rattles, and other ritual paraphernalia. All such artworks reflect visual histories and designs owned by hereditary right by each Native artist.Singletary trained at the famous Pilchuck Glass School in Seattle with glass artists such as Lino Tagliapetra and Cicco Ongaro but credits the Isleta Pueblo glassblower Tony Jojola with inspiring him to switch from making European-style works to creating from within his own Tlingit culture. Singletary has become the leader of a rapidly developing, innovative Native American glass art movement.
 ART OF POWERAlthough art has historically glorified the powerful, it can also be a means of communication and expression for those without power. These Congolese works represent opposite ends of the social spectrum. The mwaash aMbooy mask is emblematic of royal power and prestige for the Kuba kingdom of the central Congo. It represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba trace their descent, and is worn only by the king (nyim) or by local chiefs. In both its dance and as a sculpture, it is a vision of gravity and composure. The contemporary portraits by Aimé Mpane, in turn, depict the struggles of those without access to power. They show ordinary citizens of Kinshasa, along with representations of their fears and desires. The artist carves these images from plywood, turning two-dimensional surfaces into works filled with light and shadow (suggesting both presence and absence) that animate the stories of the dispossessed.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.

Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram.

 In Japan, Raku ware (Raku-yaki) is usually associated with the tea ceremony. It developed during the Momoyama period (1573â1615) when the first generation of the Raku family is said to have made tea bowls for Sen no Rikyū (1522â1591), the renowned tea master. Raku ware was once restricted to ceramics specifically made by the Raku family, but today its techniques are widely used.
 Shigaraki ware is associated with tea bowls and other utensils for the tea ceremony. However, the technique was first utilized to produce tiles for the roof of Shigaraki palace, which was built for Emperor Shōmu (reigned 724–49) of the Tenpyō period. Later, during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the technique was used for utilitarian vessels, including water jars, large pots, and farming implements. Only after the Muromachi period (1392–1573) was Shigaraki ware used for tea bowls.
 Ido ware was first made as inexpensive rice bowls in fifteenth-century Korea. When Ido ware was imported to Japan, people started to employ it for the tea ceremony, and Ido tea bowls were highly respected. The attraction of this example is its powerful form, featuring a relatively tall footed base in the shape of a bamboo stem, and its glaze pattern, which resemble the dry skin of an old plum tree.
 Shino ware was produced in the Mino area of Japan (in modern Gifu prefecture near Nagoya) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1574–1600), mainly for the tea ceremony. Shino glazes, which are always thick, come in shades of red or gray, but white is the most popular. White Shino tea bowls were in high demand among tea masters, as the white color expresses purity and is considered a perfect presentation of the spirit of the tea ceremony.
 Kohiki ware was brought to Japan from Korea, where it was known as Punch'ong ware. It takes its name from the Japanese for "ground powder," an allusion to the ware's powder-fine glaze. Kohiki ware tea bowls, famous for their deep bodies, were admired by samurai warriors of the late sixteenth century who relished the tea ceremony.
 By the time Brooklyn-based Lorna Simpson completed her M.F.A. at the University of California, San Diego, in 1985, she was already gaining recognition for her large-scale photographs focusing on the female African American figure. Subtly addressing issues of racial and gender identity in American society, she juxtaposed text with her photographs, continually presenting her female subject as anonymous by hiding part of her face or choosing a view of the figure’s back. Thus the viewer never knew these women as individuals. In Counting, Simpson presents us with three images: an African American woman, a brick hut, and braids. As in most of her work, the meaning is open-ended, but the adjacent texts suggest that the work deals with labor and slavery. The woman is paired with time slots that could imply work shifts. Text alluding to the beginning of slavery appears with a Southern smokehouse once used as a slave hut. The image of braids coupled with the text “25 twists, 70 braids, 50 locks” implies the arrangement of multiple, intricate braids, a cultural trait sometimes associated with African American women.
 Wishing Well is Thomas Woodruff’s meditation on the ravages of the AIDS epidemic rendered in the style of an Old Master painting. The initials of the artist’s departed friends are inscribed on the work, which follows the composition of the central panel of the Adoration of the Lamb from the famous Ghent Altarpiece, completed by Hubert and Jan van Eyck in 1432. Echoing the paradisical scene, with its references to the sacrificial lamb of the Crucifixion and the fountain of life, Woodruff places a plentitude of apples, birds, and rabbits around a wishing well. As in the proverb “an apple a day,” the apples suggest the possibility of healing and overcoming the menace of AIDS through hope, joy, and appreciation of the everyday miracles of life. This painting was the central piece of the artist’s exhibition Apple Canon, where it was installed with 365 images of various kinds of apples depicted with the precision of Flemish genre painting.
 The buildup of pigment and modeling clay on the velvet surface of Rockets Redglare in Paradise exemplifies the intense materiality of Julian Schnabel’s paintings from the early 1980s, a decade that saw a revived interest in the medium of painting and in expressionist brushwork. Reminiscing in 1996, Schnabel recalled that he had encountered Michael Morra, a well-known downtown actor and standup comedian whose stage name was Rockets Redglare (taken from “The Star-Spangled Banner”), on his way to see the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. When Schnabel heard that Basquiat planned to make a painting of Rockets, Schnabel invited the performer to his studio instead and subsequently created this likeness.
 When Astroland first opened in 1962, it included two of the classic Coney Island rides: the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel (left of center in this image). In 2006 the owners sold Astroland to a developer who had already assembled a large amount of land in Coney Island’s old amusement area. A short-term lease will allow Astroland to reopen next summer, but as this text goes to press, it remains unclear whether the developer’s plan for towering hotels, shops, restaurants, movie theaters, and high-tech entertainment will be accepted or rebuffed by city authorities.In the past few years, attempts to revitalize Coney Island have increased; KeySpan Park and the new Stillwell Avenue subway station are the most obvious examples. While many agree that rejuvenation is necessary, voices have been raised against the prospect of turning Coney Island into a gentrified enclave for the well-off. New York City’s creation of a Coney Island Development Corporation in 2003 brought together city officials as well as local business and community leaders. This initiative indicated awareness of the importance of caring for the area’s traditional qualities and of keeping it available to a diverse audience while providing a wide-ranging plan for economic development that would include a year-round amusement district as well as many new residential opportunities. At this moment, it is uncertain what the result of these efforts will be.
 The rise of Coney Island in the postwar years was temporary, and from the 1950s, Coney was in steady decline. Postwar suburbanization, car culture, and the creation of parkways and public state parks such as Jones Beach offered people alternatives for day trips in the summer. Robert Moses, New York City’s powerful Parks Commissioner, objected to the kind of entertainment Coney offered with its penny arcades, shooting galleries, rides, and sideshows. In 1938 his Parks Department took control of the beach at Coney Island, with efforts to increase public access and reduce the amusements. In the 1950s and 1960s large areas were used for new housing projects built on Moses’s initiative. Widespread gang violence in the 1950s frightened some visitors, and when Steeplechase closed for good in 1964, the area dedicated to amusement was dramatically reduced. Nevertheless, Coney Island as a democratic destination for everyone subsisted, as testified here in Stephen Salmieri’s many images from the late 1960s.
 Ana Mendieta: Place and PresenceBefore graduating from the University of Iowa in 1972, Ana Mendieta had already embarked upon her unique practice of blending photography, body art, earth art, and performance art as she addressed the emergence of feminism and her experience as a Cuban exile.For her iconic Silueta series, Mendieta placed her body in the landscape, using materials such as crushed flowers, sculpted mud, or ignited gunpowder to literally inscribe her silhouette, and then documented the ephemeral results through photographs and films. Returning to Cuba in 1980 and 1981, she continued to trace female forms on the ground, as in the pieces executed on the beach in Guanabo. She also began carving fertility figures into the caves and cliffs of her native land, which she called Rupestrian Sculptures. Many of these, such as the large Untitled (Guanaroca [First Woman]), were named after indigenous goddesses, simultaneously serving as political and personal assertions of Mendieta’s presence and identity, as well as reminders of ancient traditions of goddess worship.
 This is a monumental elegy for the Irish Republican Army member and long-term prisoner Mairead Farrell, who, along with two unarmed male companions, was shot to death at close range in 1988, in Gibraltar, by the British Security Service. The ghostly text in the upper right—“Your mind is your strongest weapon because they can’t control your mind they can’t get inside and that’s their failure”—was taken from one of Farrell’s last interviews. Doogan’s concentration on the female martyr is in keeping with her long-standing interest in depicting the female body with a clear-eyed realism and care worthy of Renaissance masters such as Albrecht Dürer, evident in the sensuous drapery that shrouds the martyr and the blood that seeps from her ear into the water below.
 In the wake of its humiliating defeat at the hands of Prussia in 1870, the French Third Republic sought to reinvigorate notions of heroism and citizenship. To this end, in 1884 the city council of Calais commissioned Rodin to create a monument to Eustache de Saint-Pierre. In 1347, while Calais was under siege by the English, Eustache and five other important citizens of the town had offered themselves as hostages, pleading for mercy for their long-suffering city.In his first maquette of 1884, Rodin proposed a conventional monument, with his figures united as a group on a tall pedestal. By the following year, however, the six figures were placed on a low rectangular plinth, at the same level as the viewer. As Rodin later wrote: "I wanted to have my statues placed in front of the Calais city hall on the very paving of the square like a living rosary of suffering and sacrifice."Rodin first made nude figure studies, which he then draped in wet canvas to model the sackcloth worn by the burghers when they surrendered. To create the expressive figures possible, he used the radical technique of combining studies of hands and feet from different figures. Creating the very antithesis of conventional heroic sculpture, Rodin here set out the terms of a modern, anti-monumental tradition that resonates to this day.
 These two works are part of a large series of soldiers’ portraits by the New York–based photographer Suzanne Opton. Opton photographed Claxton and Mickelson on their return to Fort Drum, New York, from service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Asking each to rest his head on a table, she shot the horizontal face close up, against a dark background. The images of these disembodied heads reveal every pore and blemish, even a wandering eyelash. Psychological portraits more than traditional representations of heroes, the exposed faces seem thoughtful and oddly tranquil, vulnerable in their naked intimacy.

 Sarah Hobbs explores the world of phobias and aspects of erratic human behavior in her constructed environments. Untitled (Eggs) is one of a number of works by the artist that focus on an obsessive gathering of selected objects. Here the viewer is drawn into the image by the seeming perfection of the eggs, which on closer examination reveal extensive flaws and cracks. Because the objects are presented approximately life-size, they relate directly to human scale, but humans are eerily absent from this photograph and similar works by the artist.
In Steffani Jemison’s Personal, three black men— professional actors based in Brooklyn who responded to an ad Jemison placed—move improvisationally through various locations in Bed-Stuy. Shot against an unfinished mural, in a public park, and on a playing field, the actors walk forward, backward, and in slow circles, with the world around them largely unaffected by their movement. Jemison moves between letting the footage play naturally and reversing it, making it unclear if the action is unfolding in real time or not. Techniques of repetition and reversal confuse time, space, and sequence. These strategies provoke viewers to consider the impact of inherited narratives and question notions of linear progress, particularly in relation to black Americans.
 Like much of Wangechi Mutu's work, Eat Cake focuses on a female protagonist: here, a mysterious woman (played by Mutu) with unkempt hair, clawlike nails, and translucent platform heels. Materializing at water's edge against a soundtrack of tinkling bells and birdcalls, she squats before a multitiered chocolate cake and then messily devours it. Hunched over and swaying, she appears both primal and enchanted. The woman's decadent clothing and voracious appetite invite reflection on our separation from the natural world and patterns of excessive consumption, while her ritualistic movements suggest an attempt to reconnect with both the earthly and spirit realms of the forest around her. Placed on the floor, Eat Cake forces us to bend over or even squat, mimicking the woman’s position and, perhaps, also that of women in society at large.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 
 With this work, the Brooklyn Museum debuts the recent acquisition of a significant collection of artworks from the Black Arts Movement, considered the cultural wing of the Black Power Movement in the late 1960s and 1970s. Nelson Stevens was a member of the Chicago-based collective AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists). AfriCOBRA used what they called “coolade colors” to create empowering images of African Americans—which they deemed “Superreal images for Superreal people.” Here a woman with an afro (then a highly political hairstyle) casts her gaze upward, as if envisioning a day when African Americans would be truly free. The word uhuru means “freedom” in Swahili, and the choice of language signaled the group’s Afrocentric politics.
 In this mixed-media collage, Ralph Arnold, a participant in the Black Arts Movement in Chicago, combined what may seem to be disparate images of politics and sports. The photograph at the lower center of the canvas shows a very young Julian Bond, then a leader of the civil rights organization Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The images of football players layered against the montage of black men marching and soldiering may also be a commentary on racial equality, since the artist created this collage at a moment when the National Football League, an organization slow to integrate, merged with the American Football League, which recruited from historically black colleges and universities.
 The artist states, "This painting is from a group of on-site works of the same location, executed at the same time of day, sunset, over the period of one year. Together they function as a set of mug shots of the place where victims of three unrelated murders were found over the previous year. One evening, as I was painting in my car, a crowd of spectators began to gather along the levee across the road. With toddlers perched on their shoulders and small children jumping at their sides, parents elbowed for an unobstructed view of officials pulling the waterlogged body of a man, victim #4, from the Trinity River [outside Fort Worth, Texas]."
 In these two photographs from the 1990s, Anthony Randell captures the atmosphere in the Brooklyn neighborhood known as DUMBO (short for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) before its gentrification. The area was developed as a manufacturing district, close to the Fulton Ferry landing, in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. In the wake of the de-industrialization of the Brooklyn waterfront, artists moved into the decaying district in the 1970s in search of large studio space and cheap rents. Over the past fifteen years, developers converted many of the old buildings to luxury apartments and turned the waterfront into an attractive park. While the area today is thriving, most artists have been forced to move to less expensive Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Bushwick and Sunset Park.

 In this drawing Duke Riley presents real and imagined accounts about the original residents as well as an imaginary group of contemporary inhabitants of Mill Rock Island, a small, inhospitable strip of land just north of Roosevelt Island in the East River of New York. Initially named Bright Passage or Hell Gate by Dutch explorers, the island and the river become a mythical place in Riley’s densely rendered scenes. Influenced by tattoo art as well as woodcuts and nineteenth-century whaling art, this large-scale drawing invites the viewer to find hidden treasures and stories depicting tales of sexual exploits with pirates, mermaids and other mythical creatures. Part of Riley’s vast multimedia project East River Incognita 1, The Bright Passage further evokes the ambiguous line between history and myth by including fragments and landmarks of contemporary life in New York.
 Sol LeWitt, active from the 1960s, was a pioneer of Minimalism and Conceptual art. He often worked with simple geometric forms—particularly the cube—straight lines, and ninety-degree angles. Hanging Structure’s suspended three-dimensional grid, composed of identical, monochromatic units, is emblematic of this interest. In contrast, Terence Koh, inspired by queer, punk, and DIY cultures, belongs to a 1990s generation whose work is more personally inflected. Embracing decay and ephemerality, Untitled (Vitrines) displays whitewashed objects collected from friends, lovers, Koh’s childhood, and flea markets, acting almost as a shrine preserving relics from his life. The sculpture departs significantly from LeWitt’s strict vision yet engages with the legacies of Minimalism and Conceptual art, exploring the possibilities of the grid and the monochrome and extending those formal considerations into the personal realm.
 Kiki Smith is known for her ongoing engagement with bodily matter and the female form, often through fairy tales and folklore. The title of the set to which this lithograph belongs—Banshee Pearls—combines terms with very different connotations. Pearls have long signified upper-class elegance and femininity, while a banshee is a female spirit in Irish mythology whose chilling screams and ghostlike pallor are omens of death. The word banshee is still used to describe women or girls who are seen as wild or inappropriately behaved. Here, repeating deathlike masks of a woman’s face ask the viewer to consider how female powerrelates to beauty and the grotesque.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 Titi in Window and Luis’s Mother are part of a series of works completed by John Ahearn and his collaborator, Rigoberto Torres, in the Longwood neighborhood of the South Bronx. Starting in 1979 and continuing throughout the 1980s, a time when this community was struggling economically and socially, Ahearn and Torres created plaster castings of their neighbors and friends. The two sculptors would often cast their subjects on the sidewalk, and then display the finished busts publicly on walls in the neighborhood.

 Throughout her career, Louise Bourgeois experimented with various methods of representing body fragments in her sculptures. Many of them employ roughly finished marble blocks, with the exquisitely carved figurative elements seamlessly growing from the stone mass. Hands appear frequently among these pieces. As the most important tool of the artist, hands are celebrated in many forms. They are expressive of character and mood, and serve in the process of communication. The two finely carved hands in Décontractée appear in a moving gesture that suggests the relaxation and release that might follow a painful experience.
 Alec Soth creates a visual record of America. In his series Sleeping by the Mississippi, he depicts not only the people and places that make up life along the river, but also the shift in culture as the river flows from north to south. Soth presents these photographs as a fragmented narrative, a rambling sequence of images similar to the flow of dream imagery or the currents of the unconscious. With his interest in the representation of the United States and its inhabitants, his portraits express a wide range of feelings, from pride to loneliness and vulnerability.This image shows a man bundled in workman’s clothes against a bleak rural landscape; he presents model airplanes to the viewer, as if explaining a project. With its implicit references to the iconic American aviator Charles Lindbergh (whose unassuming boyhood bed is shown in another photograph in the group) and to the very idea of America (in the colors and emblematic stars and stripes on one of the planes), the image is both an intimate, personal portrait of a man and his toys and a link to the rest of the series.
 This image is part of the photographer Harvey Wang’s photographic series of endangered occupations. A testament to New York City’s rapid changes, it is not only a document of a vanishing chapter of the city’s history but also an intimate portrayal of the people who held these jobs: mannequin makers, pillow makers, and scrap-metal collectors. Coney’s Cyclone roller coaster no longer has a brakeman.
 William Hawkings was born in eastern Kentucky at the end of the nineteenth century. When he was two years old, his mother died, and Hawkings was sent to live on his grandparents' farm. Although he moved to Columbus, Ohio, as a young man, much of his work depicts idyllic agrarian life, the memories of his childhood. Self-taught as an artist, Hawkins could not afford to purchase commercial frames for his paintings, and he typically painted a decorative border around his pictures.
 In this image, Willie Cole uses an iron to connect with painful and lingering histories of racial oppression, commenting on the extent to which the marks of the past live on in the present. The iron, which left a singed impression in the middle panel, suggests domestic service (Cole’s mother and grandmother both worked as housekeepers), but its form also recalls both the European ships that carried captive African laborers to the Americas and historical African masks.In the first and third panels, Cole superimposes the iron-as-mask image over his own face. By connecting a suggestion of iron marks to his face in the first panel, Cole further evokes the manner in which history has marked his body. He suggests both ritual scarification patterns and the branding irons that turned the bodies of African laborers into Western commodities.
 In the late sixties I was thinking about the triumph of the Cuban people over imperialism and U.S. dominance—the effort is here "crowned" (Corona). But Corona is also a famous cigar from Havana that is desired (and now missed) by affluent Yankees—so struggle, victory, and contradictions are part of the idea. I was working my way out of a more lyrical and abstract view of figuration at the time toward a more socially-politically oriented idiom, hoping to find a way to maintain a formally strong image. . . . This painting is in transition. . . . The form is evolving toward artistic and social relevancy. The painting has particular interest to me since it straddles these objectives and balances precariously, one foot in each world.

 Sadegh Tirafkan explores the layering of traditional and modern Iranian culture and the conflicts between Iranian and western culture in his photographs, collages, and video installations. In this photograph, the first portrait in a series entitled The Loss of Our Identity, the artist presents the viewer with a portrait of an Iranian youth in a white T-shirt with headphones, both attributes of western culture. His eyes, however, are hidden beneath a superimposed “curtain” created from a reproduction of a battle scene illustrated in a Qajar period Persian lithographed book. The image seems to question the deterioration of traditional Iranian culture in the face of an increasingly superficial world driven by new media. Tirafkan belongs to a group of contemporary Muslim artists whose work is increasingly sought by collectors and museums in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The Brooklyn Museum is proud to present this work as the first contemporary addition to its Arts of the Islamic World collection.
 Despite its having the mane of a male lion, the female body and attributes identify this striding figure as Sakhmet, whose name literally means “The Powerful One,” or another lion-headed goddess. Her attributes include a sun disk and uraeus (rearing cobra) on her head, which together connect her with the sun god Re and emphasize her roles as his daughter, the “Eye of the Sun” and protector of the king. The papyrus scepter in her left hand evokes regeneration and rebirth, among her divine responsibilities.
 Betty Woodman, the doyenne of American studio ceramics, has had a keen interest in the art of antiquity and other cultures since the beginning of her career in the 1950s. Here she has transposed the form of an ancient Japanese ceremonial bronze bell known as the dotaku into terra-cotta and then covered the handbuilt bell with a lustrous glaze, terra sigillata, inspired by ancient Roman redware.
 Converting found materials into a unique medium between sculpture and painting, El Anatsui combines diverse aesthetic traditions from Ghana, Nigeria, and the global history of abstraction. Working with discarded metal bottle caps collected from a liquor distillery, Anatsui modifies this unremarkable everyday material, chosen for both its physical qualities and its bodily connection to the original consumer, to make vast, undulating sheets. Anatsui’s sheets are pieced together and hung without prescribed orientation, taking on new shapes with each installation. This “non-fixed form,” as the artist calls it, is emblematic of Anatsui’s desire for his work to remain dynamic, inspiring creativity in those who install it and illustrating the ever-changing conditions of life.In Black Block, Anatsui uses only one color (though the black is broken up by flashes of red and yellow) and only one type of metal piece across a monumental expanse of some 15,000 elements.
 In this serene painting, Emmi Whitehorse achieves a unique balance between her modern art training and her Native heritage. Born and raised on the Navajo reservation, she lived with her grandmother and was surrounded by Navajo stories and cultural traditions. For Whitehorse, the Southwest landscape is her identity and the source of her inspiration. In this painting, loosely formed abstractions fill the surface and float in a hazy, fluid medium that could be a mirage of heat or a sandstone cliff. The floating, abstract shapes resemble seeds, pods, and roots of plants, imagery that also relates to Navajo weaving, in which plants are used as dye sources. As a child, Whitehorse collected plants with her grandmother, who hung them on the walls of their house to dry. That is the origin of the floating vegetal forms.
In his diverse body of work, Roxy Paine often deals with nature and artifice, particularly the tension between natural processes and the constructed environment. Encased in a glass box with a wooden floor and frames, the replica of a Datura plant in this piece has been domesticated. With leaves half-devoured by insects, it looks deceptively harmless—and still quite beautiful—in its decaying state. Nevertheless, the Datura is a dangerously poisonous plant. It contains scopolamine and atropine, which in very low doses can be used both as medications and as powerful hallucinogens, transporting the user to otherworldly states of consciousness. Yet, an overdose of these substances is fatal.
 Fritz Scholder, ambivalent about identifying himself as a Native American artist, often chose an objective stance in portraying Native subjects. This lithograph belongs to a series in which he challenged stereotypical perceptions of the Indian as noble, pure, and a symbol of wisdom. Standing inert with an indecipherable expression, the figure nevertheless exudes a strange power, waiting for something the viewer can only guess.
 What is Native American art and who is a Native American artist? The artist Fritz Scholder referred to himself as a non-Indian Indian, someone who never felt the pull of two different cultures. With this lithograph series he challenges popular stereotypical depictions of Indians as stoic, noble, pure, and the embodiment of wisdom. Instead, he offers an amorphous human form, showing only a scruffy face with an open mouth, though the hint of a warrior breastplate, the wrapped braids, and the sharply angled feather suggest a Native American identity. The figure’s tightly wrapped blanket and his turned pose seem to reject empathy from the viewer.
 Fritz Scholder’s imagery in paintings and prints frequently explores atypical views of Native American life. Most depictions of this subject feature the vibrant colors of the regalia and the swirling action of the Buffalo dancers, performing in celebration of their past. Instead, Scholder offers a somber depiction of the haunted soul of a man with hollow eyes. His vacant stare implies that the past is dead, the present is empty, and the future cannot be envisioned.
 Fritz Scholder’s imagery in paintings and prints frequently explores the cultural contradictions of late twentieth-century Native American life. He often shows harsh realities but sometimes presents a humorous view, as in this lithograph, in which warriors on horseback carry non-native, innocuously jaunty umbrellas. This seemingly improbable scene is actually taken from real life; umbrellas have been used by both men and women as protection from the hot sun on the Plains since the late nineteenth century.
 Helen Levitt's photograph of two children on a New York street is a wonderful example of her prolific engagement with street life. The capacity to transform the documentary into poetry, to interpret a scene on the street from a humanistic perspective and give it a new meaning, is a key feature of Brooklyn-born Levitt's lifelong photographic practice, always more artistic than journalistic.  The seemingly simple structure of this image reveals a skillful sense of composition. The graffiti and the many layers of advertisements on the back wall echo the black scribbles on the face of the boy on the left, his vertically striped pants juxtaposed with the horizontal bands of the wall in the background. Quietly and full of concentration, he is gazing at the other boy, slightly out of focus, carefully handling a bubble.Levitt studied with Walker Evans in New York in the late 1930s and began photographing city children in the 1940s, always imbuing her subjects with characteristic warmth. In 1970, she was one of the first street photographers to begin working in color.
 Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1911, Romare Bearden moved with his family to New York City in 1915, where in the 1930s he attended New York University, studied art with George Grosz at the Art Students League, and joined artists' groups associated with the Harlem Renaissance. While maintaining his strong connection with New York, Bearden frequently returned to his grandparents' house in North Carolina for the summer, and memories of the South were to inspire many of his works, such as Southern Courtyard.
 Kara Walker has succeeded in developing a signature visual vocabulary that is instantly recognizable for its engagement with both nineteenth-century imaging techniques and the historical period of the American antebellum South. In Keys to the Coop, Walker depicts a young African American girl in bold silhouette, holding the decapitated head of a chicken in one hand, while in the other she nonchalantly twirls a large key. Walker portrays a self-empowered anti-heroine who possesses the key to her own salvation, in stark black-and-white. This image also provocatively alludes to food, gender, and racial mythologies, subjects that Walker often foregrounds in her work.
 This print evokes one of the key visual metaphors associated with Kali, who is sometimes depicted as pure geometric abstraction, in the form of a yantra, rather than as a multilimbed goddess. Yantras are spiritual visualization instruments specific to the philosophy and ritual of Tantra, a sect of both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Kali yantra is a red and black diagram of interlocking triangles, lotus petals, and geometric forms, and is one of several symbolic representations of shakti (female divine energy). The inverted triangle also resonates with the contemporary use of pink and black triangles as symbols of queer identity.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 This large-scale painting is one in an ongoing Collaboration series begun in the mid-1970s, in which Schapiro dialogues with and pays homage to famous women artists, in this instance Frida Kahlo, whose self-portrait The Broken Column, 1944, is reproduced in the center. Schapiro is a pioneering feminist artist who, with Judy Chicago, founded the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, the first program of its kind to encourage women to make art from their personal experiences. A leader in the Pattern and Decoration movement, Schapiro is known for her “femmages,” or collage paintings, which aim to reclaim traditional handicrafts associated with women’s work, such as embroidery and sewing. Stylistically this painting mimics the look of a collage, recalling Schapiro’s long-standing commitment to the belief that decorative elements and women’s work are viable artistic means to express female experience, having both political and subversive potential.
 This water jar of classic Pueblo shape by Marcellus and Elizabeth Toya Medina, a husband and wife team, illustrates both the old and the new. Circling the jar, in the background, are depictions of traditional masked Kachinas who perform in religious ceremonies. Bursting into dance in front of these figures are naturalistic, muscled, male Pueblo dancers in very active dance positions, also wearing traditional regalia.
 Vija Celmins derives many of her images from photographs and is particularly interested in translating three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional surfaces. Internationally known for her intensely realistic renditions of natural environments, the artist here also conveys a sense of abstraction and illusion. Celmins recently turned her attention to spiderwebs after making images of bodies of water, skies, and sandy deserts for many years. “Maybe I identify with the spider,” she once stated. “I’m the kind of person who works on something forever and then works on the same image again the next day.”
 Sylvia Plimack Mangold's The Inversion is full of polarities: images compete with a void, geometry conflicts with nature, traditional landscape painting faces off against abstraction. The artist began The Inversion as a larger work, and it forms a narrative about the painting process: "The landscape originally stretched horizontally from left to right, side to side," she wrote. "I cropped it because it didn't work—the negation of some areas becomes a positive element in the support of the total picture." In other words, the void at the right is a kind of negative "inversion" of the positive landscape.
 Cindy Sherman’s reputation was built on the success of her Untitled Film Stills, a series of black-and-white photographs from the late 1970s in which the artist depicted herself in various typecast roles of the Hollywood heroine. In that series, she described how the male gaze reduces the female subject to stereotype. The series Fairy Tales and Disasters of the mid- to late 1980s marked a major shift in Sherman’s self-representation. External appearance became the means by which to explore the contents of an internal world, one influenced by fairytales, myths, and fantasy. If the Untitled Film Stills expressed a sense of anxiety about the lurking male gaze, then the Fairy Tales, such as this one, reveal a monstrous “other” we all carry inside. The harsh, sickly greenish-yellow lighting emphasizes the slobbering lips, decaying teeth, and tense fists of this character. The vulnerable girls and alluring temptresses of the Film Stills are replaced by grotesque figures emerging from some netherworld.
 My mother had the idea to shoot a portrait of me wearing this T-shirt printed with a Huxtable family portrait. As a child I watched The Cosby Show in order to escape the reality of my dismantled working-class family. My mother set up the camera in the bedroom doorway, facing a mirror reflecting part of her image. Both the mirror and the T-shirt are scratched, dusty, and fading in the light. In the text that I perform live, for this particular photograph I wrote, “Between my background and my foreground, I am not sure where I stand.”—LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 I found out in 2008 that both Grandma Ruby and Mom had cancer, as did many of the elder women in Braddock. Here, Mom and I explored a new approach to documenting our illnesses (mine being lupus). We stood our mattress on end and covered it with a comforter, essentially making it our studio/stage. We made a portrait of our bodies overlapping as one, unified in sickness, death, and our struggle to survive. The light cast a shadow that for me foreshadows the loss of Grandma Ruby; she passed away six months later from pancreatic cancer. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 In Self-Portrait (March 10 a.m.) I continued to document my lupus attacks. Any time I am having a lupus attack and feel up to making a portrait, I document the moment. On this occasion I had just returned from clearing out my grandmother’s apartment in Braddock after her death. I only kept a few articles of her clothing. In this portrait I am wearing her pajama pants, and a bed sheet is duct-taped to the bedroom wall. —LaToya Ruby Frazier[Text not currently in gallery]
 Although now known primarily as a landscape painter, Sylvia Plimack Mangold engaged in the realistic depiction of domestic interiors until the mid-1970s. In this painting she painstakingly describes the geometry created by a patterned parquet floor strewn with articles of clothing. Using exaggerated perspective, the artist leads us into the depth of space, implying the large scale of the room. In contrast to the elaborately set up interiors that were the subject of paintings through the nineteenth century, Mangold presents a segment of a modern household where everyone is rushing, and tidying up is the last thing on anyone's mind.
 Gordon Matta-Clark is best known for his “building cuts,” turning buildings into sculptural environments by carving through floors, walls, and ceilings. He dubbed these site-specific transformations “Anarchitecture” (a combination of “anarchy” and “architecture”); they were documented in films and photographs that were subsequently exhibited in galleries, sometimes alongside sections of the cut-out buildings. In connection with his Super 8mm film Underground Paris (1977), exploring the complex underground spaces of the city, Matta-Clark made a series of photographic works of the same title. These represent another type of cut, this time deep into the ground, where the built environment is contrasted with the city’s many buried stories. In Underground Paris: St. Michel, Matta-Clark photographed the catacombs beneath the center of Paris and created a larger image by combining many smaller photographs, often making visible the edges of the strips of negatives. This montage of several similar-looking images, both color and black and white, refers back to the Super 8mm film, taking a form like a filmstrip. At the same time, the horizontal seams between the images allude to geological layers, just as the work’s extreme vertical format mimics the descending movement necessary to reach these hidden and forgotten burial grounds. The city is visible above, with its roofline and the highlighted silhouette of a church emphasizing the contrast between past and present.
 Made in the year of Ralph Ellison’s death, Black Monolith II (For Ralph Ellison) is an homage to the author of Invisible Man that expands the possibilities of painting. It is part of a larger series by Jack Whitten honoring black visionaries in politics and the arts, many of whom (including Ellison) Whitten knew. To create this mosaic-like painting, Whitten made tiles composed of organic materials and acrylic paint and applied them to a canvas. The tiles each have a unique chemistry, with embedded materials that are symbolic. According to Whitten, the figure’s acrylic-encased razor-blade mouth references the “double edge of black identity,” which “cuts both ways.” The illumination radiating from the figure alludes to one of Whitten’s favorite sentences in Invisible Man: “The truth is the light and the light is the truth.”
 Simon Norfolk’s Israeli Sniper Wall depicts a border zone: a wall built between the Israeli settlement of Gilo, outside Jerusalem, and an adjacent Palestinian village, to protect Israeli settlers from gunfire. To brighten the view on the Israeli side, the wall has been painted with a landscape, the view as it would have been without the Palestinian village on the opposite side. The elegant composition, muted colors, and smooth tonalities of the photograph add to its almost otherworldly character. Norfolk's use of an old-fashioned mahogany and brass field camera—a large-format view camera with a slow shutter speed—also contributes to the epic quality of the image: a beauty in conflict, or at least in jarring juxtaposition, with the problematic subject at hand. Norfolk's extraordinary ability to fuse the timeless and the topical resonates with the Museum’s great collection of landscape paintings steeped in meaning, most notably the “Great Pictures” of the American West, such as Alfred Bierstadt’s A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie (1863).
 In many of his staged photographs, William Wegman uses his dogs in playful and surprising ways. At first glance October 1981, Rangeley, Maine looks like a mere forest, but further inspection reveals a weimaraner camouflaged by the foliage. Wegman’s image mischievously evokes fairy tales, fantasies, and legends, in which the forest has traditionally been used as a backdrop, and the dog emerges from the forest in disguise like a canine Robin Hood.
 Su Xiaobai engages both Western abstraction and the traditional Chinese medium of lacquer in creating this painting, at once translucent and luminous, opaque and furrowed. Su has said that this painting was inspired by Buddhist philosophy and Ming and Qing dynasty blue-and-white porcelains.
 In Liberty, Hank Willis Thomas renders a two-dimensional image as a three-dimensional sculpture. The original photograph appeared in Life Magazine in 1986 and featured a Harlem Globetrotter in front of the Statue of Liberty, spinning a basketball on his finger. Interested in popular culture, photographic history, and sports as a metaphor for individual and collective struggle, Thomas created a lifesize sculpture of the moment by casting the arm of retired NBA All-Star Juwan Howard. Liberty is part of Thomas’s Punctum series, which draws inspiration from the French philosopher Roland Barthes’s idea of the punctum: that “element which rises from the [photographic] scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces.” Using this concept as his foundation, Thomas selects a specific area of an image and re-presents it as sculpture. Through cropping and isolation, he encourages us to contemplate framing itself: what is left in or out of a photograph, narrative, or account of a historical event, and why?
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.

 Painting is about the world that we live in. Black men live in the world. My choice is to include them. This is my way of saying yes to us. -Kehinde Wiley Historically, the role of portraiture has been not only to create a likeness but also to communicate ideas about the subject's status, wealth, and power. During the eighteenth century, for example, major patrons from the church and the aristocracy commissioned portraits in part to signify their importance in society. This portrait imitates the posture of the figure of Napoleon Bonaparte in Jacques-Louis David's painting Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at Grand-Saint-Bernard. Wiley transforms the traditional equestrian portrait by substituting an anonymous young Black man dressed in contemporary clothing for the figure of Napoleon. The artist thereby confronts and critiques historical traditions that do not acknowledge Black cultural experience. Wiley presents a new brand of portraiture that redefines and affirms Black identity and simultaneously questions the history of Western painting.
 Homeless Hungry Homo comments on how gay Africans are . . . oftentimes more likely to end up in poverty because of the dual criminalization and demonization of same-sex love, by the government and the church respectively. It also comments on the fear of poverty as a result of coming out, and the notion that people will choose to remain “masked” and in the closet for that reason.— Adejoke TugbiyeleTragically, the sort of binary-free, autonomous space artists like Jacolby Satterwhite celebrate is not always available, particularly in parts of contemporary Africa. Adejoke Tugbiyele’s art advocates for richer and more humane understandings of identity and status, particularly with regard to sexual orientation.Here, Tugbiyele takes discarded and low-value materials, including palm stems, and weaves them into a figure imbued with the colors of the gay pride flag. At the same time, the figure sits in a gesture that evokes a life lived on the streets and wears a mask to conceal the subject’s identity.
 This cabinet exemplifies the work of Droog, an informal confederation of Dutch designers founded by Gijs Bakker, a product designer, and Renny Ramakers, an art historian. It consists of recycled drawer fronts inserted in newly constructed wooden boxes held together by a commercial cinch strap. Witty yet functional, it may seem to be merely a mélange of used and new furniture parts, but in fact it is a well-considered composition, balanced in both shape and color. The customer is invited to rearrange the parts at will. Droog’s dramatic and sometimes heretical approach challenges accepted ideas of decorum in design and materials.
 Adolescence has become ubiquitous subject matter in contemporary photography. Whether it is the awkwardness of Rineke Dijkstra’s gangly prepubescents or the sexuality, malaise, and dysfunction depicted by Larry Clark, the worlds of adolescents and teenagers seem to have been exhaustively described. While Lise Sarfati continues to mine this rich vein of subject matter, she evokes a slightly different tone. In her first book of photographs, Acta Est, she documented the dark, emotional territory of wayward youth in post-Soviet Russia. Robin, #43, Oakland, CA is from her subsequent project, titled The American Series. Published in book form as The New Life, the series comprises images of young people from Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, and California. Directionless, dispossessed, and dejected, these young people (mainly young women) appear ghost-like and unattached to their surroundings. Sarfati’s subjects transcend their social, political, or cultural categories; as carriers of individual, as well as universal, psychological states, they represent the interstitial space between inertia and movement. In Robin, #43, Oakland, CA, the young woman gazes into a backyard hidden from view. Framed by the intersecting lines of backyard fences bathed in a saturated cyan light, Robin may sit firmly on her home soil, but she is emotionally unmoored from it.
 Louise Bourgeois is celebrated for sculptures and drawings that powerfully abstract and critically engage the female form. Eyes sheds light on the importance of eyes as visual symbols. The third eye, as seen on Kali, has often been associated with supernatural powers in Indian mythology and continues to appear in contemporary imagery. The act of gazing into numerous eyes might also recall the practice of darshan, a dialectical and spiritual way of looking that considers the object as both image and living being, providing an experience of seeing that informs South Asian culture.—CG
 
There is something magical about a reflection in a mirror. It seems to be an accurate record of what it represents, but it is reversed left to right and is subject to manipulation and distortion. Michelangelo Pistoletto plays with the idea of reflection and the merging of art and everyday life in this work.Figures are silkscreened on a piece of reflective stainless steel, creating permanent content for the piece. But as viewers pass in front of it, temporary inhabitants of the space—you—also appear and disappear.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces, such as the "Casablanca" cabinet displayed here, were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 The use of sand to suggest the movement of water is common in traditional Japanese raked sand, or kare sansui, gardens. The most famous example is the sixteenth-century garden of the Zen temple Ryonanji in Kyoto, which in expressing the expanse of the oceans is intended to represent the entire universe. In order to achieve the same effect in his ceramic vessel, Sakiyama constructed the form from three slabs of clay that were carved into the wave pattern. After firing the vase once, he then covered it with a sand-infused glaze and refired it to stoneware temperature.
 Employing the traditional print medium of etching (most often associated with European masters such as Rembrandt), the contemporary African American artist Kara Walker loads images of the Civil War era with grotesque stereotypes and elements of violence and sexuality. By doing so, Walker challenges heroic Civil War narratives and forces the viewer to confront the dishonesty of sanitized accounts of historical race relations.

 The Thunderbolt was one of three classic wooden roller coasters constructed at Coney Island in the 1920s. Built on the Bowery in 1925 above the late nineteenth-century Kensington Hotel, the Thunderbolt was featured in Woody Allen’s film Annie Hall, in which the character Alvy Singer lived in the former hotel under the roller coaster. The Thunderbolt was closed in 1983 and demolished in 2000 together with the house, which was occupied until the end. The site remains empty today, next to the new KeySpan Park. The Tornado, the second of the signature roller coasters, also on the Bowery, burned in 1977, while the third, the Cyclone, has been a New York City Historic Landmark since 1991. KeySpan Park, home of the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team, opened on the site of Steeplechase Park in 2001 and was part of longtime efforts to rejuvenate Coney Island.
 James Turrell’s art centers on the perception of light in architectural spaces. He employed aerial landscape views in works related to his most ambitious site project, an “observatory” within the Roden Crater in Arizona. Turrell chose the site during aerial flyovers in the late 1970s, and since then he has been constructing viewing spaces that admit the natural light of the sun and stars in various ways to create specific perceptual effects. A meeting of science and art, Turrell’s work draws on the power of place, geologic time, and humanity’s long relationship to celestial phenomena.
 New technology often inspires artists to rethink traditional forms and create objects of great originality. In this instance, the designer has worked largely on a computer to realize his design. He began with a birch plywood cube, a modern building material, and two traditional images, of a Baroque table and a bombé chest (a low cabinet with serpentine curves), which he conflated and morphed on his computer. He then divided his design into fifty-seven virtual slices, or cross-sections, and utilizing a computer numerical controlled (CNC) laser, cut the cube from two directions simultaneously to create a silhouette with complex compound curves. The table is composed of 741 layers of birch plywood. It was limited to an edition of twenty that is now sold out.
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”

 By Western standards, modern jewelry making is not widely known in Israel. The few Israeli artists who do create modernist jewelry have often studied abroad and exhibit and sell their designs in Europe. Schocken, who lives in Jerusalem, was trained as an architect in Israel and then went to England to learn jewelry making. Her jewelry is reductivist and abstract and reflects her lifelong passion for modern architecture, in particular Tel Aviv's well-known cache of Bauhaus-inspired buildings from the 1920s and 1930s.

 Lynn Hyman Butler’s Coney Island Kaleidoscope series combats the idea of Coney Island as a time capsule of nostalgia. During a period of crime and political and financial instability, artists such as Butler considered the site’s uncertain fate as a subject for their work. Saturated colors glide through these playful images, taken while Butler was physically in motion, emulating the vision of a visitor in flux on an amusement park ride. The figures in these two photographs stride forward boldly in contemporary attire: sundresses and straw hats, and leather vests with tattooed arms. The vibrant energy and sense of movement and chaos reject sentimentality, alluding to the velocity of time. Butler is interested in conveying the rush of disorder and the change from past to present Coney Island, and aims to signal the need for historic preservation in its future.

 Using square steel plates coated with white baked enamel as the basic module, Jennifer Bartlett explores the fine line between representational and abstract painting. Characteristic of her work during this time, Bartlett used this module technique, basic geometric figures, and primary colors—in this case the triangle and the color red—to reveal the fragile line that separates an abstract symbol from an ordinary object, such as a house or a mountain.
 This young boy, a child laborer, alludes to both the global history of sugar and the contentious history of representation of African and African-descended people. Operating in what Kara Walker calls “the fissure between desire for and revulsion against,” he demonstrates both racist objectification and strange affection. Made of resin and coated in sugar, he highlights the impact of the triangular trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas, and the enslaved people who were the foundation of the sugar industry and of European and American economies from the sixteenth century on. This figure is a permanent version of an attendant from Walker’s installation A Subtlety, a public project at the Domino Sugar Refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2014.
 In some regions of Ghana, it is typical for the shape and style of a coffin to make a personal statement by reflecting the profession, interests, or characteristics of the deceased. The mother of many children might have a coffin in the shape of a hen with chicks. In this case, it is a Nike sneaker, a symbol of status and modernity in the late twentieth century. As people make the transition from one world to the unknown next, an object (a coffin) representing another object (in this case, a shoe) provides comforting familiarity.
 This relief was once brightly painted, as was most temple decoration. Unlike most temple reliefs, however, it was partially inlaid. The corpulent figures, labeled as bodies of water, were part of a procession of geographical personifications conveying the idea of parts of Egypt showing their submission and bringing their bounty  to the temple.
 This work is inspired by Gary Simmons’s ongoing exploration of sports, history, race, and class in American popular culture. It is based on the tragic events surrounding a nationally televised boxing match at Madison Square Garden on March 24, 1962. Emile Griffith and Benny Paret, immigrants from Saint Thomas and Cuba, respectively, battled for the welterweight title. Paret was gravely hurt and died from his injuries ten days later. Vintage fight posters, with the two fighters’ names clearly visible, make up the background of Convention Hall. Two ghostly falling stars, portraits of sorts, perhaps allude to the hardships both men experienced, in and out of the ring.
 Coming to Detroit at an early age, Harry Bertoia first learned jewelry making and later studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he remained after graduation to head the metalworking department. Bertoia created large-scale public-sculpture commissions as well as small-scale decorative pieces such as Bush, which demonstrates his early training in jewelry and fine metalworking. Although abstract, Bush evokes an underwater creature or a dandelion plant that has lost its fuzzy spores.
 Dotty Attie often appropriates historical works of art by male artists to demonstrate gender inequalities within the art world. Barred from the Studio is part of her late 1980s series Episodes from the Lives of the Masters. Here Attie adapts two famous works by the American painter Thomas Eakins, Max Schmitt in a Single Scull, 1871, and The Gross Clinic, 1875. Her text documents the uproar caused when Eakins, a professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, allowed female students to attend life classes with nude male models. She points out the hypocrisy of Victorian society, which took offense at not only the frank representation of a surgeon’s bloodied hands, but also the idea of women observing and understanding male anatomy.
 Hellen van Meene’s photograph is an illuminating example of this young Dutch photographer’s practice of portraiture. The young woman looks away from the viewer, her body contorted, as if frozen in a movement to shield herself from invading gazes. Light streams through a window from outside the picture, falling softly on her pale skin. It highlights not only her dyed blond hair but also her shoulder blade, oddly jutting out, unsettling the contour and emphasizing her thin frame. The partial shadow reveals the texture of the skin, including goose pimples and the deep impression of a bra. Like her fellow Dutch portraitist Rineke Dijkstra, van Meene focuses on transitional states, usually, in van Meene's case, the pubescent girl, her vulnerability and doubts, poised somewhere between childhood and womanhood. As with many of van Meene's subjects, this adolescent has been posed by the artist to play a role. Interested in the dramatic potential of portraiture, in the tradition of artists such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Claude Cahun, van Meene does not intend to objectively document her subjects nor to catch their personalities, but rather, with the help of her models, to create a certain mood. Selecting subjects among young people she knows in her neighborhood as well as teenagers she meets on the street when traveling, van Meene carefully stages her pictures. Usually set in a shallow space, close to the picture plane, the models are prepared down to the smallest detail: make-up; wardrobe, if any; the pose; the direction of the gaze. And in this case, the little flower that just makes it into the picture in the lower right corner.
 Alison Elizabeth Taylor’s Security House examines the contemporary landscape and culture of the southwestern United States. She uses marquetry, a woodworking technique dating from the Renaissance, to depict a dilapidated tract house amid an unkempt yard. Selecting wood veneers in a variety of grains and earthy desert tones, she embellishes the scene with details that suggest narratives relating to housing foreclosures and fears about border security. Security House taps into a long-standing romance with the American frontier, while also suggesting the persistence of boom-and-bust cycles that have historically characterized towns in the West.
 
 Photographed in a studio against a neutral background, Andres Serrano’s portrait shows a Navajo woman in traditional dress. While the photograph’s large scale monumentalizes the subject, Serrano depicts his sitter in a direct and dignified manner, producing a sense of engaging intimacy. Serrano has explored fundamental issues related to sex, religion, race, and prejudice throughout his career. Whatever his subject matter, he always considers himself a portraitist. He has often expressed his admiration of both August Sander, the 1920s chronicler of people in various segments of German society, and Edward S. Curtis, who in the early twentieth century aimed at documenting the disappearance of traditional life among the indigenous peoples of North America. Curtis has been criticized for fabricating a false reality, staging scenes and retouching his photographs to conform to a stereotypical idea of traditional Native culture. To Serrano, however, it is the sense of dignity in Curtis’s depictions that matters, and this quality comes through in his own portrait of Lyndell Yazzie.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian designâthe exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Leon Polk Smith was born in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) a century ago. After receiving a Masters in Art Education at Columbia University in 1938, he had his first one-person exhibition in 1941. Since then his work has been featured in countless exhibitions worldwide.An admirer of the abstract paintings of Piet Mondrian, Smith decided early in his career to dispense with the recognizable object as part of his paintings. In the mid-1940s he began painting abstract compositions based on the relationships of basic geometric elements, which he gradually reduced to a minimum.Jubilee, one of Smith's late works, is an extreme example of this economy of means. The four lines seem to move across the canvas, suggesting spatial relationships and depth of field. The painting illustrates well a statement of the artist's creative principles that he wrote in 1961: "Three elements which interested me in art are line, color, and the concept of space and its use as a positive force."
 This flamboyant necklace is typical of the decorative projects of Rhonda Zwillinger, who is also a well-known avant-garde photographer and was a leading artist in the emergence of New York's East Village as a vital center of contemporary art in the 1980s. Using inexpensive plastic sequins and beads, Zwillinger embellishes her jewelry, everyday objects such as found handbags, and entire room installations to astonishing effect. This necklace, which the artist describes as "wearable ecstasy" sold for $125 at the Gracie Mansion Gallery in the East Village in 1987.
 ART OF BELIEFEach of these works is the product of a religious tradition that synthesized and adapted new beliefs and art forms to existing faith systems. Both objects are testaments to the long-standing global nature of African religions, ideas, and art. The stone sculpture represents Serapis, a composite god created early in the Ptolemaic (Greek) rule of Egypt to unite Greeks and Egyptians. The deity combined aspects of Egyptian gods (especially Osiris, the ruler of the Underworld) with Greek deities (particularly Zeus, the king of the gods). Worship of Serapis continued in the Roman period and eventually spread to Europe. The painting depicts al-Buraq, the winged horse with a woman's head on which the prophet Muhammad flew the mi'raj, his nocturnal journey to heaven to meet God. Like many in Senegal, Gora Mbengue was a member of a Sufi order, a group dedicated to the practice of a mystical interpretation of Islam. Sufism played an important role in the spread of Islam in West Africa, inspiring schools and movements particularly open to melding new and existing systems of belief and image making. Reverse glass painting (souwère) developed by 1900 in Senegal's cities, as pilgrims on the hajj to Mecca brought the technique back from the eastern Mediterranean.
 As she has done in the past, Nina Abney here creates a highly personal, imaginative, and eclectic interpretation of a literary source. Forbidden Fruit, part of a series inspired by Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, alludes to the chapter featuring a hookah-puffing caterpillar. According to the artist, the composition of the figures and the choice of light blue and green were drawn from Henri Matisse’s 1909 painting The Dance. Sea-Monkeys (a species of brine shrimp sold as curiosities during the artist’s childhood) provided the model for the two figures with antennae sitting on the left, and the numbers that appear on various figures also have personal meaning for Abney. Though the original Alice is absent here, Abney’s boldly hued hallucinatory scene populated by fantastic creatures vividly simulates the magical environment of the text, in which Alice experiments with mushrooms that allow her to grow and shrink in size.
 ART OF WRITINGBoth of these works, separated by many centuries, use the human body as a platform for expressing and displaying script. Shabtis are funerary figures intended to do the agricultural work the gods might require of the deceased, represented here holding hoes. The hieroglyphic inscription on this figure is a spell from the Book of the Dead, asking the shabti to do the Nubian king Senkamanisken’s work for him in the afterlife. Owusu-Ankomah's paintings depict a spiritual world occupied by people and symbols. The male figure in this work is covered by, and moves within, Akan adinkra symbols from the artist's native Ghana, each of which graphically represents a particular concept or proverb. Looking Back Into the Future depicts a nude man with his head turned backward, in a pose associated with the Akan proverbial concept of sankofa ("one must know the past to know the future"). You can see a contemporary version of adinkra cloth among the "touch" textiles around the corner.
 ART OF PORTRAITSWhile Western artists have historically often attempted to represent a person exactly how they look, many African artists instead have created portraits based on a specific physical or personality feature of the subject. This terracotta head, most likely depicting the oni, or king, of ancient Ife, shows that Yoruba sculpture was already highly developed a thousand years ago. Ife court art interprets the human figure with extraordinary naturalism. This head, however, is not intended to be truly representational or realistic. It shows the oni in the prime of life, with no imperfections. Fiegnon is composed chiefly of a discarded oil jerry can. Although Fiegnon may appear to resemble a mask, Romuald Hazoumé has noted that his works are, in fact, portraits—of particular individuals or of social types. With its long braids, this work represents a Fulani man Hazoumé met fishing in the lagoon where he found the oilcan. The striking differences in style and materials in these two portraits may also reflect a marked gap in status and power between their two subjects.
Kaneta Masanao forms his pieces using the kurinuki technique, which involves scooping, pinching, and scraping a block of clay into the desired shape. Like many other Japanese studio potters, Masanao sees a close link between sculpture and ceramic art.
 These images belong to the Australian artist Tracey Moffatt’s nineteen-piece Laudanum, a series of photogravures embracing a turn-of-the-twentieth-century aesthetic in costume, character, setting, and medium. The title refers to a pain reliever and sedative commonly used in the nineteenth century. The medium, a combination of photography and etching, was likewise popular during this time. The narrative depicts the highly charged relationship between a white mistress and an Aboriginal servant involved in a sensual power struggle in which their roles often reverse.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.
 ART OF DESIGNAfrican artists have a long history of responding to fresh design concepts, while always revising them to ends both practical and novel. Together, these three works trace the evolution of a single form: first, as an imported idea became African, and then as contemporary artists adapted this African form for a global market. Most seats in sub-Saharan Africa are low stools, carved from a single block of wood. Yet, as early as the sixteenth century, Portuguese traders and explorers introduced chairs with backs to southern and eastern Africa. Chokwe artists soon began to produce similar chairs, adding sculptural scenes and Chokwe motifs. This wood chair was carved as an object of status for a chief. In fact, none of these three chairs were meant for sitting. Gonçalo Mabunda's Harmony chair uses decommissioned handguns, bullet belts, and other munitions collected from the estimated 7 million weapons left in Mozambique following the end of its civil war in 1992. Its design references a coastal East African tradition of high-backed chairs that were symbols of power and prestige, discussion and debate. The Sansa chair, an inventive deconstruction of the chair form, is among the original creations that have established Cheick Diallo as one of Africa's leading contemporary designers. Built at Diallo's direction by artisans from Bamako, the half-reclining Sansa chair seems to sit midway between a European notion of the chair as a leisure object and a West African idea of the chair as a support for displaying a person of status.

 Music played an important role in Romare Bearden's art. He especially loved jazz, and his method as a visual artist was based in part on what he had learned from jazz musicians about improvisation. As in jazz, the unpredictable repetitions and juxtapositions of shapes, textures, and colors in his art create startling, unexpected visual rhythms. As Bearden once said about being an artist: "You must become a blues singer—only you sing on the canvas. You improvise—you find the rhythm and catch it good, and structure as you go along—then the song is you. Music has always been important for me the way it has been important for many Blacks. Blacks have made their own sound, their own musical language like jazz. It is theirs and they identify with it. In a world of constantly changing identities, certain forms of music represent a solid identity for Blacks."
 Shooting primarily in the United States and the Caribbean, Deana Lawson is inspired by the expression and aesthetics of black cultures worldwide. Using a large-format camera, and working across a variety of photographic traditions—including portraiture, staged scenes, found or appropriated imagery, and vernacular photography such as family albums—she addresses themes of the body, sensuality, community, and spirituality, among others. Lawson’s photographs can be seen as psychological portraits of black subjects in an extended, mythological diasporic family.
 Since the early 1990s, Nick Cave has been fabricating inventive sculptures out of scavenged materials, which he often overlays with beadwork, stitching, and other embellishments. One of the first, crafted from twigs, was made to be worn and created a rustling sound, which led to the eventual name of such works: Soundsuits. Cave’s costumes draw from a variety of sources, including both African and Caribbean traditions of masquerade.In performance, Cave’s work invokes moments of whimsical transcendence—but a very real, grounded, and nuanced understanding of the racialized nature of American society is often just underneath. Overcoming the distinctions between “fine art” and “craft,” as well as “performance” and “street” art, Cave’s Soundsuits may also serve as a sort of armor, protecting against the violence of racial stereotypes and giving their wearers an outsize, fanciful, and transcendent presence. Cave designed his first Soundsuit in response to the brutal police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1992.Cave’s costumes enable performers to be seen free from the constraints of being placed in categories, and to be free to transform their environment into an otherworldly space.
 In the ongoing series Sunday Paintings, Byron Kim inscribes personal notes about his daily life onto his painted images of the sky. In nuanced hues of blue, each of the six examples shown here represents the sky on the Sunday it was painted. The words sit on the picture plane, creating a play between the painting as a flat surface and as a window opening onto the illusion of deep space. Lined up on a wall, the Sunday Paintings have a cinematic quality: each panel looks like a frame in a film sequence—a moment in time stilled—as if each is a part of a larger ongoing whole. While the works were created on Sundays, the title of this series also refers to amateurs known as “Sunday painters,” admired by Kim for the purity of their motives in making art.

Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.In 1980, Ettore Sottsass, Jr., one of the senior Italian designers of the time, founded the Milan design cooperative Memphis with two colleagues, Andrea Branzi and Allesandro Mendini. Memphis pieces were self-consciously flamboyant riffs on the postmodern design then in vogue. Although the cooperative lasted only for five years, its risky exuberance expanded the boundaries of modern furniture and continues to influence designers today.
 Sol LeWitt, active from the 1960s, was a pioneer of Minimalism and Conceptual art. He often worked with simple geometric forms—particularly the cube—straight lines, and ninety-degree angles. Hanging Structure’s suspended three-dimensional grid, composed of identical, monochromatic units, is emblematic of this interest. In contrast, Terence Koh, inspired by queer, punk, and DIY cultures, belongs to a 1990s generation whose work is more personally inflected. Embracing decay and ephemerality, Untitled (Vitrines) displays whitewashed objects collected from friends, lovers, Koh’s childhood, and flea markets, acting almost as a shrine preserving relics from his life. The sculpture departs significantly from LeWitt’s strict vision yet engages with the legacies of Minimalism and Conceptual art, exploring the possibilities of the grid and the monochrome and extending those formal considerations into the personal realm.
 ART OF IDEASAfrican art is conceptual art. In both form and use, it reveals sophisticated systems of knowledge, but rarely directly. These two seemingly unrelated works express hidden and poignant ideas about security and liberty. An nkisi nkondi embodies defensive power and was used to protect a community. To complete this sculpture, a ritual expert placed potent ingredients associated with supernatural powers in the cavity carved into the figure’s abdomen. Nails and blades activated the spirit that was now accessible through the figure. This nkisi's pose, with hands on hips, symbolizes its readiness to defend the righteous and to destroy enemies. In Viyé Diba's work, the piece of painted yellow wood, projecting between the seams of the woven canvas, and the abstract forms that suggest fleeing figures at the top evoke the possibility of liberation—from the literal plane of the canvas, from the strictures of painting and sculpture, or, perhaps, from the history of the city of Dakar itself, the site of a former way station in the trade of human captives. Diba's art is composed entirely of materials he found walking around Dakar.
 This fragment from one of the stained-glass windows that Henry E. Sharp designed for the Church of St. Ann's in Brooklyn Heights in 1867–69 illustrates the artist's decorating technique. Some of the elements in his windows were solid pieces of colored glass; others were pieces of colorless glass overlaid, or flashed, with a thin layer of colored glass–in this case, dark blue. The colored glass was coated with a vitreous black paint, a stencil was placed over the paint, and a craftsman scratched away the black to reveal the design. The glass pieces were then fired in a kiln to fix the black color. Over time, the black paint slowly faded, as can be seen in the pale yellow ground of the complete window by Sharp displayed here. The more intense black seen in the window's three central medallions and blue, red, and green borders is the result of recent conservation. Colorless glass was placed on the back of the faded pieces, and the original design was repainted in black on the new glass.
 Walton Ford draws his inspiration from the work of such artists as the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century fantasy painter Hieronymus Bosch, the nineteenth-century naturalist John James Audubon, and the nineteenth-century French caricaturist J. J. Grandville, whose parthuman, part-animal subjects satirize man’s shortcomings. Although very different from Ford’s more recent watercolors, these four early oil paintings, a series of family portraits where the image is complicated and turned grotesque by the juxtaposition of repulsive elements close to the sitter’s face, hint at the artist’s continuing interest in the association of man and animal. Ford often explores this interest in relation to the history of colonialism, nineteenth-century industrialism, or contemporary politics.

 Green Hands and Faces is from a powerful group of paintings by Ross Bleckner that take on a subject of importance to the artist since the 1980s—the loss of friends and loved ones to AIDS. Each luminous spot on the canvas's surface stands metaphorically as a glowing flame, a flickering symbol of a deceased person whose life remains as a memory. As if created by a source emanating from the depth of darkness, the "hands" and "faces" are the result of fine modulation of reflective oil paint and varnish.
 Incorporating a well-worn wooden table and a misshapen ceramic bowl, Jessica Jackson Hutchins’s Kitchen Table Allegory uses design objects to create a sculpture that evokes the private world of the home. The table served Hutchins and her family until she decided to use it as the plate for a series of prints that were initially presented with the sculpture. Personal without devolving into the confessional, the work situates the source of creative inspiration within the familial and the everyday.
 A Composition for Detroit is a portrait of contemporary America. Inspired by many trips to Detroit and its banks of broken factory windows, some overpainted, Sara VanDerBeek built structures that functioned as supports for leaning panes of glass and a wide range of photographic imagery. She then photographed her ephemeral installations before dismantling them. The photographic material includes close-ups of images such as, in the first panel, a Walker Evans photograph of the ruins of a pre–Civil War plantation in Louisiana and a Charles Moore picture of a crouching woman, sprayed with water, during a 1963 civil rights protest. VanDerBeek also used documentary material, some dealing with riots in Detroit in 1967, as well as her own evocative photographs of abandoned buildings and broken blinds. The photographs contribute to the subtle telling of stories that move from left to right across the four panels, or from back to front within each panel. According to the artist, the allusions to windows, stairs, and doorways in all the panels open up the possibility of either staying where we are or taking off in new directions.
 “It was my first self-assigned art project at twenty years of age,” Stephen Salmieri says of his Coney Island series, “My instincts knew better than I did.” The artist’s feelings of spontaneity and independence are echoed in this photograph of four boys with fishing rods in hand perched atop jagged boulders and surrounded by waves. Here, Salmieri underscores the sense of exploration and adventure that Coney Island provides to young people who crave a break from the city.

 This work by the Salish, French-Cree, and Shoshone artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith explores the challenges of Native American coexistence with American culture. The Plains woman’s dress featured prominently in the painting is worn by those in the Ghost Dance Religion to recall the vision of John Wilson (better known as Wovoka), who prophesied that white people would vanish and Native Americans would return to take back the land that was once theirs. The religious movement offered hope to many homeless, ill, and hungry Native Americans, and its message and surrounding tensions are, according to the artist, conveyed through various elements in this work: the eagle appears as a messenger of the prophecy; bingo cards are meant to represent the Catholic Church’s introduction of gambling to reservations; and written texts convey the “Queen of Hearts” children’s rhyme, a reference to power.
 Conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth reproduces a quotation from Austrian-born Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations, published in 1953. That volume, composed of 693 numbered paragraphs, examines the topic of language and its ability to create meaning. Wittgenstein’s text questions our perception of blueness; Kosuth responds in a sense by representing that text in glowing blue neon, as part of his own ongoing investigation into the elusive relationship between words, things, and their visual representation.
 Kiki Smith’s Annunciation continues the artist’s long exploration of monumental sculptures of women that examine both the physical and psychological aspects of the body within a feminist context. The figure, with its suit and bald head, is gender-neutral. Its oversize head, delicate features, and dangling feet convey a sense of vulnerability, while its upraised eyes and outstretched arm suggest engagement in a rich inner life. Drawing upon her Catholic upbringing, Smith uses the Annunciation—the angel Gabriel’s revelation to the Virgin Mary that she will conceive Jesus—as a metaphor for the moment of creative inspiration.
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Kara Walker subverts the original function of nineteenth-century cut-paper silhouettes, initially used for portraits of socially prominent individuals. She reinterprets the medium to create intense explorations of relationships based on power. Here, working in cut steel, Walker includes stereotypical Civil War imagery of the South—a stately plantation mansion, small huts, enslaved African Americans, Confederate soldiers, and Southern belles. As she explores stereotypes, Walker offers no resolution, and her presentation includes neither villains nor heroes. This “play set” even seems to suggest that the cast of characters and their settings could be reorganized, creating new narratives that revolve around issues of oppression and power, race and gender, and moral ambiguity.
 The Half Moon Hotel opened on the boardwalk in 1927. Its name referred to the explorer Henry Hudson’s ship, which anchored off Gravesend Bay on Coney Island in 1609 before continuing toward what would be called Manhattan and the Hudson River. Initially fashionable and well attended, the hotel suffered from the general decline and became a maternity hospital in the late 1940s. A senior citizens’ home was built on the site in the 1970s. This ghostlike image by John L. Murphy captures the memory of time past at Coney Island. Filled with both sadness and nostalgia, it conflates many layers of the site’s history.
 Becoming AgainMasquerade is a moment for play—a chance to invent and experiment, even within established social needs and existing mask genres. These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.The two Bobo works share a basic form—a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns—typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.The Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.
 In his short life, the artist Michael Richards often created work related to the struggles and triumphs of African Americans. He spent nearly ten years, for example, on a series of sculptures dedicated to the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black aviators—named for their base in Tuskegee, Alabama—who during World War II became the first African American military pilots in the history of the United States. For this particular sculpture, as with others in the series, Richards made a fiberglass mold of his own body and then pierced the work with nails (other sculptures in the series are impaled by toy airplanes). The sculpture thus refers both to Christian iconography (St. Sebastian, depicted with a body full of arrows) and to African objects known as nkisi nkondi.In a tragic and eerie twist of fate, Michael Richards was working as an artist-In-residence with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council at its studios in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001, and died in the attack on Tower 1. He did not live to witness the surviving Tuskegee Airmen receive the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal, on March 29, 2007.
 Yuji Agematsu has been transforming the raw material of life into art for nearly thirty years. In the Zip series, an array of objects—collected during the artist’s daily walks through New York City—are displayed on shelves, with each unit of shelves representing a month’s collecting. The pieces are both a record of his wanderings and a repository for the residue of our collective consumption. Collector, curator, and archivist, he states: “I walk around the city during the night too. The empty streets have a feeling akin to a beach when the tide is low. The objects are left where both big and small waves of the consumerist society have ebbed; people call them rubbish, waste, trash, and so on, which nevertheless talk to me, even eloquently at times.”

 At the forefront of the African-American avant-garde in Los Angeles and New York in the 1960s and 1970s, Senga Nengudi was first recognized for her anthropomorphic nylon mesh sculptures, such as Inside/Outside. The bulbous stockings twist and strain under the weight of the sand they contain, calling to mind both the rhythm of a swinging pendulum and exposed internal organs. The work also conjures the image of a traditional African headdress, telling of Nengudi’s interest in African philosophy and ritual. The artist’s background as a dancer and choreographer informs her practice, and she has often utilized works such as Inside/Outside in her own performances, testing the limit of her constructions by wearing and stretching the nylons to the brink of bursting.
 In 2005, Mary Coble staged a twelve-hour endurance performance titled Note to Self, in which she had the first names of 438 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender victims of hate-crime murders tattooed over her entire body without ink. Vivid evidence of Coble’s harrowing artistic process appears in this photograph. As the fresh needle punctures imprinted names on her lower leg, the artist’s blood mingled with an older ink tattoo, a rainbow-hued chain of figures emblematic of a diverse community. This documentary photograph shows Coble’s body as a locus for reflection on both the physical nature of assaults inflicted on hate-crime victims and the reporting of their deaths. The artist’s preparatory research revealed that anti-gay words were carved into some of the victims’ skin. She also discovered that no centralized database exists for hatecrime statistics, since individual states are not required to report hate-crime deaths to the FBI or any other federal agency.
 Fred Wilson often appropriates art objects to explore issues of race, gender, class, politics, and aesthetics. Made up of five portrait heads of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, Grey Area (Brown Version) refers to one of the most copied works of ancient civilization. The otherwise identical plaster effigies, which he purchased and painted, illustrate a value scale ranging in color from oatmeal to dark chocolate. Thus, Wilson raises, but does not answer, controversial questions about the racial identity of ancient Egyptians. In both his provocative, groundbreaking installations in cultural institutions and in his studio work, Wilson encourages viewers to recognize how changes in context create changes in meaning. He has said of his practice, “I use beauty as a way of helping people to receive difficult or upsetting ideas. The topical issues are merely a vehicle for making one aware of one’s own perceptual shift—which is the real thrill.”
 Mickalene Thomas creates monumental pictures that explore and challenge the representation and objectification of women, and black women in particular. She draws inspiration from images of iconic African American women, emblems of the Black Power Movement, and her mother’s photographs from the 1970s. Here, she casts an African American woman as leading lady in an updated version of an established visual archetype—a sexualized female subject seemingly caught unaware as she reclines passively in her own beauty. In doing so, the artist turns the historic nude on its head and ousts the white European woman from the bed where she often lounges, attended by a black maidservant, in Western art.
 Hew Locke constructed Koh-i-noor, one of three monumental portraits of Queen Elizabeth, out of hundreds of kitschy plastic toys and trinkets, disposable products of the new global economy. The bristling blades of toy sabers suggest might and power. With this work, Locke, who was born in Britain and raised in Guyana, explores tensions between contemporary British society and its colonial past. The title refers to the Koh-i-noor diamond, a legendary treasure dating back to fourteenth-century India. Once the largest diamond in the world, it passed through the hands of Sikh, Mughal, and Persian rulers as a highly prized spoil of war. In 1877 the British government declared Queen Victoria the Empress of India, and the diamond entered the British Crown Jewels collection.
 BM (3Fb) is part of Luis Mallo’s Open Secrets, a recent group of photographs taken in museums in New York City and elsewhere. The series focuses on storage areas and reveals hidden spaces not typically accessible to the public. This image, from the Brooklyn Museum, shows storage for sculptures whose identity in most cases is partially obscured by protective wrapping. The photographer’s careful composition represents only a fragment of a larger whole, revealing the beauty within the more or less organized structure of museum storage while not decoding the system itself. Mallo does not stage or rearrange any items, and his mostly straightforward composition aspires to an objective viewpoint. The combination of sometimes random objects, however, creates a sense of mystery and reminds us that collections are not always easy to classify.

 Norman Mizuno began making jewelry as a child in his native Hawaii, helping his mother fashion pieces from tropical seeds and nuts for the tourist trade. According to the artist, the beads that constitute this necklace, which he terms "clay body jewelry," were made between 1972 and 1980 and then reconfigured in 1990. Mizuno cites a wide variety of influences, from ancient Egyptian and Mayan artifacts to Las Vegas showgirl costumes.
 Matsubayashi Yukoan, who is based in Uji, Kyoto, works in the subtle gohonde style of Asahi ware, a centuries-old specialty of the Matsubayashi family. This work, which was designed expressly for the Museum collection, has the superb coloration referred to as higawari ("changing in the fire"), a result of the interaction between kiln structure, pine fuel, and a special clay called kase.
 The motif of "three friends" popular in East Asian literary culture is here presented as a repeated stylized shōchikubai (pine, plum, and bamboo) pattern carved in a diagonal rectangular grid.
 Modern Artists and Ancient EgyptLorraine O’Grady uses ancient Egyptian art to explore contemporary issues. Artists from many times and places have been inspired by the heritage of ancient Egypt to make new works that speak to their own time. Displaying works like this within the Egyptian Galleries allows visitors to participate in the ongoing dialogue that artists have pursued with the ancients, as they have expressed their stake in ancient history and its continuing relevance. Lorraine O’Grady’s photographs grew out of a 1980 performance called Nefertiti/Devonia Evangeline, which took place in front of a series of projected images similar to the ones seen here. The work examined the troubled relationship between O’Grady and her deceased sister, Devonia Evangeline, through juxtaposed portraits of the Egyptian queens Nefertiti and Mutnedjmet, of a later reign, proposed by some scholars to be Nefertiti’s sister. Though the subject matter is deeply personal, it allows O’Grady to address issues of class, racism, ethnography, and African American art. Thus, as the artist says, her work attempts to “make the historic personal and the personal historic.”
 Wendell Castle, one of America’s most important contemporary furniture makers, has had several distinct stylistic phases in his career. At first he employed both exotic and native American woods to produce furniture characterized by biomorphic forms and attenuated surrealism. By the 1960s, he had begun experimenting with plastic and fiberglass to create seamless organic designs. In the 1980s, he became fascinated with Post-Modernism and produced highly architectural, polychromatic designs. In 2007 he received the Brooklyn Museum/Modernism Lifetime Achievement Award. The Nirvana chair was a gift of the artist in acknowledgment of the Museum’s ongoing commitment to his work.
 Kehinde Wiley presents large-scale portraits of young black men as saints and angels, in poses inspired by paintings from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In creating these monumental paintings, Wiley borrows poses, imagery, and titles from works by master painters such as Tiepolo (1727–1804). Dressed in their everyday clothes, the figures float over flat, brightly colored backgrounds suggestive of infinite space. By placing these "new" subjects within the context of art history, Wiley challenges the prevailing representations of black men in contemporary American society.
 Jules de Balincourt’s monumental painting Not Yet Titled continues a tradition of portraying dramatic landscapes that characterized the Hudson River School of painters. Unlike his predecessors, whose elaborate studio canvases drew on specific details of actual sites, here de Balincourt favors a generic touristic landscape with a steep waterfall that empties into a body of water ringed by palm trees. Tiny figures in boats enhance the atmosphere of leisure-time pleasure, which is set against the forces of nature. Utilizing a flat, painterly, almost intentionally naïve technique of painting, de Balincourt can be regarded as part of a general revival of painting that began to occur in the early twenty-first century. The acquisition of Not Yet Titled will initiate an intriguing dialogue between contemporary practice and the distinguished nineteenth-century American landscape paintings in the collection. Born in France and educated in the United States, de Balincourt is based in Brooklyn.
 George Bradford Brainerd’s photograph of Fourth Avenue, close to the southern edge of Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood, shows the low-cost dwellings lining the street in the late nineteenth century. Crowded tenement buildings replaced the shanties about 1900, and until recently the wide and heavily trafficked avenue retained much of its neglected character. Over the last few years, however, gentrification reached this lower section of Park Slope, and the old tenement buildings are now being razed or upgraded to make space for more expensive housing.Further south, Red Hook is undergoing a similar transformation. With easy access to the open sea, Red Hook became a busy industrial area in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, dominated by the activities of the port and inexpensive housing for workers of local businesses. By the time of Lynn Saville’s photograph in the late 1990s, however, many of the industrial structures had long been abandoned and artists and artisans were occupying the former warehouses. The demolition earlier this year of the sugar refinery in the background of Saville’s picture signals the definite turn of the neighborhood in a new direction. An explosion of residential and retail construction and a recently inaugurated cruise-ship terminal are examples of the contentious redevelopment of the area.
Native American artists Marcellus and Elizabeth Toya Medina and Kevin Pourier create works inspired by both old and new art forms. The painted designs on the water jar of classic Pueblo shape combine traditional masked Kachinas in static poses with naturalistic, muscled, male Pueblo dancers who seem to burst off the vessel’s surface. The inlaid buffalo-horn spoon, a traditional Plains implement, is given a contemporary twist in Pourier’s homage to M. C. Escher’s hypnotic prints.
 In Shack, Elizabeth Murray takes apart the structure of a house, simultaneously showing its interior and exterior, the cobblestone path leading to it, and a window through which the sun is visible. Although her art usually grows out of everyday experiences, she made this print after one of her paintings, working from a Polaroid image. Irregularly shaped, with overlapping planes and elements that project from the surface, Shack explores the creative possibilities in transferring a work from canvas, and pushes the boundaries of printmaking, while maintaining the artist’s signature cartoon-like style.
 For Lydia Buzio the forms of traditional vessels are the starting point for an untraditional treatment that employs contemporary aesthetics and techniques. After the basic shape is selected, the artist draws urban scenes, frequently based on New York cityscapes, on the unfired clay. Each vessel is a work in progress as the artist reevaluates the results and develops the piece by adding color and detail with pigmented slips. She burnishes the surface carefully before firing and then waxes it lightly.
 George Segal was an innovator in sculpture known for his installations of white plaster figures with ghostly appearances. He depicted the dignity in everyday life, showing people poised at a bus stop, paused before a traffic intersection, or conversing on a park bench. Segal's work also took on political themes such as the Holocaust and gay pride. At the time this sculpture was created, the artist discussed its art historical references: "The chair is like a ladder with steps, the box is like a house, the girl is like a Greek caryatid holding up the roof . . . I've always liked the hardness and softness combined, this wedding of organic and geometric."
 
 Sitting directly on the floor, like a Minimalist sculpture, Mitumba Deity consists of lumpy bundles of fabric, stuffed toys, and articles of clothing. Composed of Smith’s own garments and those of friends, the piece alludes to the global economy through the path of secondhand clothing. The piece was inspired by a film that tracks a T-shirt with a university logo from a thrift shop in New York to a mountain village in Africa, where it is purchased by a man and becomes his second shirt. Mitumba is a Swahili word that literally means “bundles” and refers to the packages and articles of used clothing donated by people in prosperous countries to charitable causes. Mitumba Deity is from Smith’s series of bundle sculptures.
 Combining a Minimalist-inspired aesthetic with a love of ordinary materials such as drinking straws, pencils, adhesive tape, and paper plates, Donovan creates delicate but monumental sculptures that evoke forms found in nature. To compose this work, she rolled sheets of Mylar to form cones and then glued these smaller units together to create molecular modules. Characteristically, Donovan exploits the properties of her material—in this case, the reflective surface of Mylar, which responds to light in different ways.
 In this piece, spelled out in sparkling coal crystals are the words “something in me wondered ‘What will happen to all that beauty?’” This quotation from a 1962 essay by James Baldwin (reprinted the following year in the volume The Fire Next Time) is set over a blurred black-and-white image from the Million Man March, a gathering of black social activists in Washington, D.C., in 1995. The accumulation of crystals suggests the mass of participants in this historical event as viewed from above, while the juxtaposition of Baldwin’s text and the image of the march—cultural events separated by over three decades—reminds us of the still-ongoing dialogue about race in America.
 Snoop Dogg is part of Andres Serrano's series America. It attempts to document the current social reality of the U.S.A. In addition to Snoop Dogg, the series includes images of such diverse personalities as a Playboy Bunny, a homeless man, a firefighter, a street vendor, a boy scout, and an assistant at an investment bank. Undertaking the series in response to the shock of 9/11, Serrano set out to answer the question of who we are and what the diversity of America actually looks like. He captures the humanity of his subjects while at the same time the scale of the figures, as they are positioned within the picture frame, gives them almost heroic proportions.
 In this drawing each Lakota woman wears elaborate regalia and carries a fan and a pouch, items used to decorate and honor horses. Warriors and horses in battle are depicted on their clothing. According to the artist, Horse Nation “honors ‘tasunka wakan’ (the horse) for its importance for the Lakota People. The horse allowed them to increase their mobility for hunting, expand their territory, strengthen their ‘akicita’ (protective warrior societies), improve their economy, relieve their burdens, and, most importantly, gave women someone else to love.”
 The New York artist JoAnne Carson’s Bouquet is a big, fantastic representation of a floral arrangement. Its stems are assembled from copper, fiberglass, and resin, bolted to a base of steel, while the individual flowers and leaves are made from thermoplastic, which becomes stiff when dry. Despite the rigidity of the materials, the overall effect is one of fragile beauty, heightened by the delicate turquoise and purple-blue color of the blooms. With its mixture of recognizable and imaginary flowers, this very decorative, oversize piece conveys a sense of otherworldly fantasy.
 Always interested in changing identities, Cindy Sherman consistently acts as her own model. Her photographs depict female characters and usually imply a narrative outside of the picture frame. Sherman’s visual vocabulary is shaped by American culture, and her characters are inspired by types from film, fashion, television, and advertising. The photographs in this group portray women outside of the domestic sphere, distant from traditional female roles as mothers and wives. Untitled Film Still #38 shows a woman cautiously wading into a stream, her posture suggesting that this excursion has a purpose, a goal to be reached within the story. The blurred composition is the result of Sherman’s first experimentation with a heavy telephoto lens, which weighed the camera down on the tripod and altered the focus. Sherman welcomes this element of chance in her work.
 
 Shown in 1972 at the De Luxe Black Arts Center in Houston, one of the first U.S. exhibition spaces to place the work of artists of color alongside that of their white peers, Power Flight takes an experimental approach to painting, moving it off the wall and into three-dimensional space. Freed from the confines of a stretcher, the canvas, composed of five connected triangles, is pulled taut by ropes. The resulting shape suggests nomadic shelters, easily assembled and disassembled by individuals fleeing harm. Using the colors of the Pan-African flag, Joe Overstreet connects metaphors of flight and nomadism to transnational struggles for black liberation.Committed to both experimental art-making and socio-political engagement, the artist notes that his life and work have been "tied up in abstract shape with what black [people] have felt and struggled." In 1973 he and his wife founded Kenkeleba House, a New York gallery focused on artists underrepresented by mainstream institutions.
 Petah Coyne’s fantastical forms, presenting a beauty that slides into the grotesque, allude to death and decay. Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculpturesproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works—the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.Coyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.

 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.

 C. C. Wang, a renowned scholar and collector of Chinese art, was trained in classical Chinese painting in Shanghai before settling in New York in 1947. His paintings drew upon Chinese conventions while reflecting his engagement with modern Western art. This particular work continues the long tradition in which mountain imagery expresses the vast forces of nature and man’s place in the cosmos. Yet, with his expressionistic painting of massive granite cliffs and dramatically lit storm clouds, Wang achieves a new portrayal of the venerable landscape theme.
 Lynn Hyman Butler’s Coney Island Kaleidoscope series combats the idea of Coney Island as a time capsule of nostalgia. During a period of crime and political and financial instability, artists such as Butler considered the site’s uncertain fate as a subject for their work. Saturated colors glide through these playful images, taken while Butler was physically in motion, emulating the vision of a visitor in flux on an amusement park ride. The figures in these two photographs stride forward boldly in contemporary attire: sundresses and straw hats, and leather vests with tattooed arms. The vibrant energy and sense of movement and chaos reject sentimentality, alluding to the velocity of time. Butler is interested in conveying the rush of disorder and the change from past to present Coney Island, and aims to signal the need for historic preservation in its future.
 At the time that Steeplechase closed in 1964—a victim of rising crime, neighborhood decline, and competing entertainment—a new amusement park, Astroland, had already been established for a few years between Surf Avenue and the boardwalk west of West Tenth Street. This park carried on the Coney tradition during the following decades. In 1983, the not-for-profit corporation Coney Island USA was created to assist in rejuvenating Coney Island’s amusement life. It developed many of the programs that later generations of visitors recognize, such as the Mermaid Parade, Sideshows by the Seashore, and concerts on the boardwalk. Lynn Butler’s dynamic take on the site in her Coney Island Kaleidoscope series documents a gritty and still spectacular Coney Island.
 For her series Coney Island Kaleidoscope, Lynn Hyman Butler photographed while in motion “to capture the sense of time passing.” The resulting effect produces dreamscapes saturated with color: riderless kiddie horses hypnotically glide in The Red Horse; a teenager holds either a toy gun or the real thing in The Girl with a Gun. Butler wants her photographs to serve as reminders that “the decision of whether to save or relinquish landscapes such as these will be of increasing urgency.” The nighttime scene behind the gun-toting girl features neon signs for the famous El Dorado Carousel, the Wonder Wheel, and the Cyclone, which alert the viewer to the potential dangers of demolition and development — to what can still be lost.

 In the portfolio Samar Hussein Vera Lutter commemorates the civilian deaths caused by the war in Iraq since the invasion on March 20, 2003. The title derives from the name of the thirteen-year-old Iraqi girl who was the first recorded civilian casualty. Lutter adopts images of a hibiscus flower’s life cycle, from the opening of the bud to the blossom’s final disintegration, as a metaphor of the transience of human existence. The petals’ reds, pinks, and ivories, which mimic the tones of human flesh, further underscore the comparison.
 This photograph is part of Mitch Epstein’s series Family Business, which traces the decline of Holyoke, Massachusetts, a once-prosperous industrial town, through the example of his own family’s waning fortunes. The series becomes a metaphor for many small American towns in flux, depopulated and with jobs in short supply.Walls darkened by soot, Apartment 304, 398 Main Street shows a building belonging to Epstein’s father that was condemned after a fire. Yet the image also forms a stunning still life—an emblem of the fragility of life.
 Anthony Goicolea’s Ice Storm depicts a frigid, fable-like place, an ambiguous and unsettling enchanted forest where a group of young men, seemingly knitting and some of them masked, gather in isolation. Inspired by myths, fairytales, dreams, and childhood fantasies, Goicolea’s image, part of a series called Sheltered Life, is a mysterious landscape partly constructed by the artist with the help of digital technology. Like the other images from this series, Ice Storm focuses on alternative living spaces in environments that often dwarf the inhabitants. The remains of an animal carcass, leftovers of an enigmatic, primeval scene, lie at the foot of the tree in the foreground, while brown bags of unknown content can be seen in several places. The beauty of icicles and ice-covered twigs, but also the dangers amid the rocky outcrops and ravines in these unforgiving and overwhelming surroundings, pose questions about this particular living arrangement.
Geometric shapes defined by densely brushed dots fill this canvas by the contemporary Australian Aboriginal artist Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungurrayi. Part of an artistic movement that began in the early 1970s with the Pintupi clan, of which he is a member, Tjungurrayi adopted the format of painting on canvas to depict what might be considered a cosmological landscape that encompasses the past, present, and future. The serpents relate to ancestors who created the waterholes, indicated by concentric circles, at a specific desert, with the background patterns representing its sand hills. These symbols are drawn from centuries-old cultural traditions of Australian indigenous peoples—including stories of creation, legends of ancestors, and daily customs—that are passed down orally or through ephemeral sand paintings.
 This mask represents Bak’was, a malevolent, ghostly spirit and the keeper of drowned souls in Kwakwaka’wakw culture. Although he is diminutive, his stride is four times the length of a man’s. He has a green, hairy body and a skeletal visage. Those drawn into the forest by him or who eat his food go mad, losing their souls and becoming part of his ghostly retinue. A soul can be saved by subduing Bak’was with menstrual blood. Bak’was appears when family ancestral masks are worn during performances of Tla’sala potlatch ceremonies, special tribal celebrations. Esta máscara representa a Bak’was, un espíritu fantasmal malévolo, guardián de las almas ahogadas en la cultura Kwakwaka’wakw. Aunque diminuto, sus pasos son cuatro veces el largo de los de un hombre. Tiene un cuerpo verde y peludo y rasgos esqueléticos. Aquellos empujados al bosque por él, o los que han comido de su comida enloquecen, perdiendo sus almas y volviéndose parte de su séquito fantasmal. El alma puede salvarse sometiendo a Bak’was con sangre menstrual. Bak’was aparece cuando máscaras ancestrales familiares se utilizan en actos de ceremonias de potlatch Tla’sala, celebraciones tribales especiales.
 ART OF INNOVATIONThese three works speak to the highly inventive history of Yoruba art. Incorporating outside materials, they each reflect how both a colonial past and global exchange shaped shifting ideas about local identity. Even this bead-embroidered crown, the ultimate symbol of Yoruba kingship, is the product of a complex global story. Although the Yoruba have a long history of glassmaking, the large, multicolored ade crown depicts figures wearing bowler hats and contains beads imported by the British in the late nineteenth century into what would soon become the Nigeria colony. The smaller beaded crown, known as an oríkògbòfó, is an evolution of the ade form, but it is modeled after the wig of a British barrister (lawyer), still worn in court today by members of the Nigerian judiciary. Yinka Shonibare, a British artist of Yoruba and Nigerian descent, used Dutch wax-printed fabric to create Skipping Girl. This material—a commodity associated with Africa but actually created in Europe, based on Indonesian designs, and sold in West Africa—serves as a symbol of the web of economic and cultural interrelationships among Africa, Asia, and Europe. Shonibare exposes cultural "authenticity" as an illusion and evokes the layers of historical connections among global cultures.
 Titus Kaphar’s The Jerome Project (My Loss) belongs to a larger series of the same title that the artist began in 2011. Searching online databases for his father’s prison record, he found dozens listed who shared his father’s first name, Jerome, as well as his surname. Struck by this discovery, he created ten-inch portraits of each Jerome, based on their mug shots. The diptych on view here shows Kaphar’s own father, at a much larger scale than in previous works in the series. Depicting African American men, who are greatly overrepresented in the prison system, the portraits are simultaneously individual and collective. The panels were painted on flat gold-leaf backgrounds and partially submerged in tar. Initially, the level of the tar reflected the percentage of each lifetime spent in prison, but Kaphar abandoned this formula in acknowledgment of incarceration’s lingering aftereffects, such as difficulty securing employment and loss of voting rights. The portraits draw on the visual tradition of Byzantine icons, specifically depictions of Saint Jerome, patron saint of students, librarians, and scholars.
 ART OF SATIREMasks are particularly useful for expressing disapproval and thus reinforcing communal values. These two masks performed instructional and critical messages about proper behavior and political discontent. Male Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. This mask depicts a French gendarme, a colonial soldier, and was most likely performed as a critique of French personal and political behavior during the colonial period. The mask depicting Elvis Presley belonged to the Nyau society (to which all Chewa men belong), an institution that governs the spiritual realm of death and the ancestors. The society’s masks always represent the spirits of the deceased, but they may also represent wild bush spirits or caricature personalities from the wider community. Outsiders—including Swahili slave traders, British officials, the Virgin Mary, and other iconic foreigners such as Elvis Presley— have been considered representative of antisocial traits and undesirable values.
 Today covered in a coat of red paint, the steel tower of the Parachute Jump is the only remaining sign of Steeplechase Park. In the years during and after World War II, riders were hoisted to the top of the tower in a canvas seat attached to a closed parachute. When they were dropped from the top, only the parachute would slow the descent. Like the Wonder Wheel, the Cyclone, and Childs Restaurant, the tower is now protected by its landmark status and will remain at Coney Island even after the redevelopment of the area. Like several other steel structures that made their way to Coney Island, the Parachute Jump originated as a ride at a world’s fair (in this case, the 1939 New York World’s Fair), reflecting the often-utopian nature of the ventures that developed Coney Island over its history.
 Morrison Cousins, a noted American industrial designer, was hired by the houseware company Tupperware to redesign its ubiquitous kitchen food storage vessels in the 1980s. This strikingly reductivist tazza also was designed by Cousins, but not for retail; it was a limited-edition incentive award for Tupperware distributors in Japan.
 In the postwar period Coney Island remained an almost obligatory subject for most photographers visiting or living in New York. New and more affordable lightweight cameras allowed photographers to be freer in the exploration of their topic. Brooklyn-born Stephen Salmieri had just graduated from School of Visual Arts in New York when he started his Coney Island series in 1966. Working in the tradition of many mid-twentieth-century independent photographers (such as Robert Frank and Lisette Model) who found Coney Island an inspiring subject, Salmieri spent the following six years documenting a decaying area, still full of life. Last summer there was still a limited stretch of concession stands on the Bowery, not much different from the ones in Salmieri’s suite of images. Even though some barkers are now relying on electronic amplification to lure passersby to their games, the original intention remains the same.
 Glenn Ligon’s work, known for its stenciled quotes, often blends reportage, words, and images in ways that challenge traditional classification. The artist explores issues surrounding race, sexuality, politics, and representation. In 2003 he discovered that one of his earlier print projects, featuring text from the author Zora Neale Huston’s 1928 essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me,” had not been cancelled by the printer. Cancellation of a series (by marking the plates with an X) ensures that no unauthorized copies of an artist’s work are executed. For Untitled (Cancellation Prints), Ligon himself cancelled the plates by drawing large drypoint Xs on them but then authorized an edition from them. The artist stated, “Cancelled but present, new but haunted by the ghosts of their earlier meanings, the prints speak to the mutability of questions of racial identity and a shift in the cultural context in which the original works were received.”
 The ordinary necessities of everyday life—beds, sinks, and stoves—are transformed into luxuries when they are taken out of context for use in the great out-of-doors; goods that seem rudimentary in the domestic sphere appear opulent at a campsite. Toland Grinnell emphasizes that metamorphosis in Pied-À-Terre, where a host of consumer goods are not only assembled to make a compact and portable living environment reminiscent of big-game hunting and Adirondack camps but are also repackaged to reflect the contemporary fascination with designer label luxury goods, in this case complete with the artist’s gilded “TG” monogram. Born in Brooklyn in 1969, Grinnell examines issues of consumer culture, decadence, and luxury in his work.
 Relate to Your Heritage combines the visual language of psychedelic posters with multiple fragments of African American female figures, constructing a culturally specific articulation of femininity and power. Both this work and Eyes of Time point to the importance of the feminine form in linking a collective mythic history to present-day autonomy and power. Barbara Jones-Hogu was a founding member of AfriCOBRA, a movement of visual artists formed in 1968 that sought “an approach to image making which would reflect and project the moods, attitudes, and sensibilities” of African American self-determination.—CG[Text not currently in gallery]
 Wayne Higby calls upon the western landscape of his childhood to create works that pay homage to the grandeur of nature and create a focal point for meditation. In the “Trapped Terrace Gap” Bowl the fracture of the ground represented on the outside wall of the piece is continued on the opposite inside wall. Seen from the proper angle, this natural feature jumps the “canyon” of the void between the walls. At the same time, the earthenware bowl is made from the very earth it represents.
 Using Coney Island as a setting, the photographer John Murphy created tableaux that captured the bleakness of the lives of fictional sideshow and carnival people. Here, a woman straddling a wooden chair faces a painted banner advertising her act at Coney Island’s Lido Theater, which closed in the 1970s. The contrast between her former glory as a performer and her current reality, emphasized by the empty room, is stark.
 A seemingly endless stretch of empty beach underscores the tranquility of this scene photographed by Harvey Zipkin. A small African American congregation heads to the water for a baptism. In the distance sits the Half Moon Hotel, a once popular Coney Island venue that was demolished in 1996, two years after this image was taken.

 During the last decade of his life, Philip Guston made paintings that combined the imagery of his early murals with the gestural brushstroke of his abstract painting of the 1950s. He created narratives in a cartoon-like style, returning repeatedly to certain motifs, all evident here: the solitary light bulb, severed arms and legs, horseshoes, and the soles of hobnailed boots. Brushed in broad strokes and a vivid red palette, the objects set against a curtain in an interior space allude to tragic events, both personal and in the wider world.
 With a kaleidoscopic array of brilliant colors and bold geometric patterns, Romare Bearden evoked the mystery and vitality of African spiritual traditions in Wizard’s Domaine. Although there is no clear narrative, the white-robed figure at right seems to be entreating the winged character of the wizard, gazing down on his domain from the sky. The remainder of the composition is densely packed with the forms of a building, other figures and animals, and plants, as well as abstract symbols and decorative passages.Throughout his career, Bearden was particularly interested in the African American experience, but he also believed that a universal “prevalence of ritual” united people across generations and cultures. He drew stylistic inspiration from a variety of sources, including African art, Cubist and Dadaist collage, jazz music, and Caribbean landscapes.This work has been placed on view as part of Romare Bearden: 20th Century American Master, a centennial tribute organized by the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Romare Bearden Foundation. Events and installations nationwide mark the hundredth anniversary of Bearden’s birth. For more information, visit beardencentennial.org. To find out where to view other Bearden artworks in the tristate area between now and September 2012, visit studiomuseum.org.Born in North Carolina, Bearden moved to Harlem with his family in 1920. He produced his earliest work as a cartoonist for school publications at Boston University and New York University. While at NYU, he took art classes at the Art Students League. Following his service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Bearden studied philosophy in Paris, where he came into contact with modernist artists. Back in New York, he supported himself as a songwriter and a social worker in the early 1950s and then resumed his work as an artist in the 1960s. He was a founding member of Spiral, a collective of African American artists formed in 1963 to explore their role in American art and society. During this period, Bearden began making the widely acclaimed collages that became the hallmark of his oeuvre.
 The proportions of this piece by the prominent installation artist Pepón Osorio are rather ambiguous: the two giant stuffed cats seem to be too large for the narrow table on which they sit. This incongruity reflects the artist’s recollections of visiting his mother’s apartment, filled with knickknacks and figurines, when he was an art student. The objects were in sharp contrast with the aesthetic values of the art world he was entering, and his conflicting feelings of repulsion and attraction assumed giant dimensions in his mind.
 This coiled basket is anything but traditionally executed. It was created especially for the Museum by the artist. Around the exterior it depicts eleven different women, each wearing the traditional dress of her tribe or nation. Each woman holds a three-dimensional basket woven in the style of her people and, facing outward, presents it to the world. The circle of women is repeated on the interior, where they compose a community of basket makers and present their baskets to each other.
Worn during spectacular night dances, this helmet mask represents a leaf spirit, one of the many bush spirits depicted by kavat bark-cloth masks.The mask is formed by stretching bark cloth over a thin cane frame. The pigments that decorate these masks have general symbolic associations: red with masculinity, reminiscent of the flames through which the mask dances at night; black with femininity, the soot of cooking fires, and fertile earth; and white with the spirit world.
 In radical contrast to George Bellows's dynamic scenes of New York City's industrial and architectural transformation, this depiction of laborers on the California shoreline shifts his focus to the elemental drama of man and horse in working partnership. The painting was well reviewed in New York soon after it was completed, with one critic deeming it a continuation of the "epic manner of Winslow Homer."
 Like many 1920s figure painters, Lorser Feitelson attempted to interpret the ideal, or perfected, human form in a distinctly modern way. In this mythological subject, he based the exuberantly contoured figures and complex, dance-like composition on the elongated figures and virtuoso compositions of sixteenth-century Italian Mannerism and its nineteenth-century French heir, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Working in Paris, Feitelson no doubt was aware that Pablo Picasso had already moved in this direction, creating beautifully outlined figures inspired by classical sculpture and Renaissance painting. Although this work’s chalky, fresco-like colors also refer to Renaissance art, the figures are lithe, athletic, and unmistakably modern.
 The undulating lines of the wooden bowl shown here evoke a jellyfish in motion, or a leaf curling in the summer sun. Russel Wright experimented with these curving, biomorphic shapes in several media and clearly found them interesting in their own right. Although neither easy to make nor particularly suited to their purpose, these bowls were, however, wonderfully playful and suggestive of nature to the consumers he targeted.
 These two paintings by Aleksandr Yakovlev show the artist’s key role in ushering in a new classicism in post- Revolutionary Russian art. Yakovlev trained at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts but traveled at a young age to Italy and Spain, where he applied the light and modeling of the Old Masters to modern subjects. Unable to return to Russia after the outbreak of the October Revolution, Yakovlev settled in Paris but continued to travel across the globe, immersing himself in world cultures. Arab Merchant was painted in Tunisia.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.

 The modernist poet Marianne Moore is readily recognizable here by her slender face and neck, her elongated fingers, and her signature mannish dress. Notwithstanding the reductive and linear approach to form in this portrait, it crackles with personality, conveyed through the artist’s use of expressive lines and physical distortions, particularly in the hands.Marguerite Zorach and Moore were both involved in New York City’s vanguard cultural circles and admired each other’s works. Zorach’s richly colored paintings and embroideries served as the source of inspiration for Moore’s poem “In the Days of Prismatic Color” (1923).
 David Smith's The Hero conflates the abstract and the figurative, for discernible in this geometric steel sculpture is a life-size female. She is revealed frontally, balanced on a pedestal, with a rectangle for a torso, two triangular forms for breasts, and fragments of a tank top for a head. The Hero is a forerunner of more than ten sculptures produced between 1952 and 1960 that Smith titled his Tanktotem series. "Tank" refers to the industrial tank lids or boiler tops he used to construct his pieces, while "totem" may indicate the influence of Sigmund Freud's book Totem and Taboo.
 The coiling inner structure of Seymour Lipton’s Earth Forge II suggests the processes hidden within both the natural world and the human mind. As the artist said: “What goes on behind the flower in the bud, what goes on in wintertime under the ground, what goes on in the hidden recesses of the human heart and the human mind, these things are very real to me.” The inner world of nature becomes a refuge from the hustle and bustle of 1950s America.
 With its male figure seated on a schematic throne, Personnage is likely related to Bacon’s paintings from the early 1950s inspired by Diego Velázquez’s mid-seventeenthcentury portrait of Pope Innocent X. This canvas, which shows traces of an earlier image through the thickly applied pigment, appears to be one of many that Bacon abandoned before completion. A 1982 letter from the artist to the Brooklyn Museum reveals that Bacon discarded the painting in 1956–57, considering it a failure. He gave it to an artist friend, who apparently did not follow through on his intention to obliterate the image and paint on the other side. Here, as in Bacon’s many other unfinished canvases, the power of the artist’s vision still makes itself felt.
 Luigi Lucioni and Paul Cadmus probably met as students, and they doubtless shared acquaintances within New York’s circles of gay artists and writers. Lucioni’s likeness of Cadmus celebrated the shared passion of two young moderns for the ideal forms of Italian Renaissance art, particularly the paintings of Piero della Francesca. Within a modern close-up format, he captured a gaze that is at once tentative and mesmerizing.
 
 The story of Aladdin and his magical lamp enjoyed considerable popularity with U.S. theater audiences during the early twentieth century, as did productions with ornate costumes, elaborate sets, and Asian acting troupes, often performing in pantomime. In this image of the Korean actor Pilgun Yoon in the role of Aladdin, Albert Herter (son of Christian Herter of the American furniture firm Herter Brothers, whose cabinet is nearby) referred to the strict frontal poses of formal Chinese portraiture. His interest in a decorative aesthetic is evident in the robe’s elaborate pattern, based on Chinese Qing dynasty court dress.
 Decorated doors are found throughout West Africa, each area having its own distinct style. Often such doors mark the homes of important people, such as rulers or religious leaders. This door, darkened from years of use, is ornamented with a carefully balanced combination of curvilinear and angular designs. The attached lock is decorated to match the door.
 ART OF THE BODYThese five artworks from throughout the African continent display the range of approaches artists have taken to figural representation. They prove that the Western tradition of naturalism— depicting the body precisely as observed in life—is not even remotely the only possibility open to an artist. The Mossi mask celebrates the female form. While it is not an exact replica of the body, the proportions are relatively balanced. The Yoruba tapper, used with a board to draw images during divinations, was carved with more exaggerated proportions, partly in order to contain it within the functional form of a tapper and the shape of the ivory from which it was carved. The Fang figure, a masterpiece by a known artist or workshop, has primarily been reduced to a series of basic shapes—cylinders and circles. The legs and hips are conceived as the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders, echoing the cylindrical reliquary box on which the figure sat. The small Nsapo-Nsapo work and the Chamba figure take the abstraction of the human form even further by greatly exaggerating the proportions. The Nsapo-Nsapo example's stretched arms and the Chamba sculpture's outsized hands suggest different emotional states for these two protective figures—a tense anxiety, perhaps, in one and a lumbering aggression in the other.
 Oqwa Pi (Abel Sanchez) was one of several promising painters who learned the basics of mural painting and watercolor at the Santa Fe Indian School. Moving back to San Ildefonso Pueblo, he led an active life as a religious leader and statesman, holding the position of Tribal Governor for six terms. In addition to raising his large family and fulfilling his extensive community obligations, he maintained a successful artistic career, fitting in his painting between feast days and using his dining room as a studio. His work features scenes of secular ceremonies and, as seen here, of his community’s daily life.
 This painting depicts the performers of the Hopi Corn Dance. Louis Lomayesva omitted the background in his images, thereby emphasizing the figures while adding a timeless quality. His paintings nevertheless mirror reality, as seen here in the fine details of the woven designs on the dancers’ shawls and belts. Lomayesva was one of several artists who incorporated traditional Native painting styles from hides, pottery, and murals with the European-derived medium of watercolor to create a new Native American art form.
 This painting depicts the performers of the Fall Corn Dance. Waldo Mootza omitted the background in his images, thereby emphasizing the figures while adding a timeless quality. His paintings nevertheless mirror reality, as seen here in the fine details of the woven designs on the dancers’ skirts, the body decorations on the clowns, and the raised banner over the leaders.Mootza was one of several artists who incorporated traditional Native painting styles from hides, pottery, and murals with the European-derived medium of watercolor to create a new Native American art form.
 The furnishings exhibited at the Paris 1925 International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts were a cause for great excitement and inspiration for designers and consumers alike, who looked forward to the future in the wake of the First World War. Hammond Kroll, who was interested in American Colonial furnishings and began cabinetmaking at age twenty-two, was one of the designers who, by his own account, were "fired up" by the Paris exhibition. During his brief career in furniture design, between 1927 and 1939, Kroll crafted high-quality sparsely decorated elegant furniture such as this chair, part of a suite given to the Museum.
 This piece of jewelry illustrates the transition from the more conservative handmade jewelry of the Arts and Crafts style to the modernist jewelry that embraced the abstraction of the twentieth century. Charles Price was a metalsmith at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan, founded in imitation of the Bauhaus in Germany to teach good design coupled with handcraftsmanship. In the 1930s, as Price was creating this necklace, Alexander Calder, the wellknown American sculptor, began to create jewelry that spoke in the modernist idiom shared by Arthur Smith and the other jewelers.
 An oshe shango, or dance wand, is carried by devotees at the annual festival for Shango, the god of thunder and lightning. The double ax-blade motif on the figure's head represents a thunderbolt, associated with the sudden, overwhelming, and unpredictable power of of Shango. The female figure balancing the thunderbolts on her head represents a devotee of the god.
 Taken in 1940, these photographs capture women in Harlem who rejected the limitations of domesticity. In Street Scene 2, there is a clear assertiveness about the standing woman, with her left arm holding a stack of newspapers and her right hand on her hip. In Lady and Lamp, the subject’s reclining posture and distanced gaze are juxtaposed with her formal attire, suggesting the need to unwind after a long day of work. Like other New York City neighborhoods at the time, Harlem was still recovering from poverty, overcrowding, and other devastating symptoms of the Great Depression. Details in these photographs, such as the ripped fabric on the arms of the chair and the “Furnished Room” si, hint gently at the harsh conditions that these modern urban women were up against.
 Anna Mary Robertson Moses—better known as Grandma Moses—began painting in her late seventies, after decades of working on a farm. Early Skating is one of more than 1,500 of her paintings that depict the seasonal activities and landscape of her rural community in upstate New York. As is characteristic of the artist’s distinctive style, the action is concentrated in the lower half of the composition, and the figures are described in flat, reductive shapes with minimal details.
 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer. Seedpod rattles and metal bells added a musical aspect to the performance.Although they are danced by Luvale men, mwana pwevo masks depict women. In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.

 These large keystones of male heads wearing garlands of grapevines represent satyrs (mythological creatures that are part human and part animal) or, perhaps, Bacchus, the god of wine in classical mythology. Their lively visages once adorned the facade of the Park Lane Hotel at Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Streets in Manhattan. The fourteen-story building was demolished in 1966.

 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 The lower portion of this drum is decorated with relief carvings of spirals and concentric arcs that were originally painted white and red. The large face, with its projecting tongue, is meant to be threatening, indicating the power of the clan that owned it. Above and below the face are two cassowary birds.This drum is closely related to three other published examples, which all may be by the same artist. All were collected at the beginning of the twentieth century. The design is reportedly that of a Chambri drum captured by the Iatmul people and then used to celebrate their victory. This type of drum, which originally had a membrane covering the top, provides accompaniment for clan songs on ceremonial occasions such as funerals, the launching of new canoes, or the completion of a clan house.
 “I think a view from my window would make an interesting composition,” Grace Hartigan wrote the year she painted East Side Sunday. At the time, Hartigan was living and working on the Lower East Side, a colorful neighborhood filled with tiny shops huddled among fruit stands, pickle and herring vendors, antique storefronts, and bakeries. The energetic brushstrokes, vibrant bursts of color, and stirring shapes in this painting render the artist’s observations with an imaginative and fragmented sense of movement.
 The daughter of prosperous Swiss immigrants, Marie Zimmermann was born in Brooklyn and studied art at the Art Students League and Pratt Institute. Although she was often influenced by Asian and ancient Egyptian art, which she no doubt saw on visits to the Brooklyn Museum, these candlesticks illustrate an affinity with the restrained Anglo-American interpretation of the Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Zimmermann and Elizabeth Copeland, the maker of the nearby box, were among the few women metalsmiths to achieve national fame.
 These two paintings by Aleksandr Yakovlev show the artist’s key role in ushering in a new classicism in post- Revolutionary Russian art. Yakovlev trained at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts but traveled at a young age to Italy and Spain, where he applied the light and modeling of the Old Masters to modern subjects. Unable to return to Russia after the outbreak of the October Revolution, Yakovlev settled in Paris but continued to travel across the globe, immersing himself in world cultures. Arab Merchant was painted in Tunisia.
 A keen observer of the mundane routines of domestic life, Bonnard simultaneously conveys both familiar intimacy and isolating distance in the shared space of this cheerful breakfast room. While the vantage point implies a place for the viewer across from the seated woman, the austere jutting wedge of the white tablecloth and the placement of the basket of fruit set her apart. Moreover, with her head and shoulders bowed over her cup, the woman stirs her drink with meditative self-absorption. Bonnard further underscores the detachment of the figures with the turned back of the retreating child.
 In this chair, George Nelson experimented with the same materials and forms as did his contemporaries, but with a different result. The fiberglass shell of his chair is two-toned, with a sweeping void between the two sections, deliberately denying the unity to which other designers aspired. Nelson ran a large design firm, and many of the works attributed to his office were actually designed by employees. This chair was probably created by Charles Pollack.
 Although one of the twentieth century's most prolific creators of handmade jewelry, William Spratling stood consciously outside the modernist movement thatt flourished during his career. Trained as an architect, he was introduced to the idea of jewelry making during sojourns in Mexico beginning in 1926. In 1929 he moved to Taxco, Mexico, the site of centuries-old silver mines, and set up a company of local artisans to revive the art of silver hollowware and jewelry. His designs were inspired primarily by pre-Columbian motifs. This venture became an enormous success, especially during World War II and immediately after when department stores in the United States were cut off from European suppliers of luxury goods. Unfortunately, Spratling lost control of his company to other investors, and by 1946 Spratling y Artesanos was out of business. Thanks to his apprenticeship system, however, his legacy continues in Mexico today.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 Shunkahmolah, a leader of the Black Bear clan priesthood, showed this headdress to the ethnologist Francis La Flesche and Brooklyn Museum curator Stewart Culin when they visited him in 1911. According to Osage consultants, the headdress was used in ritual preparations for the hunt.The Osage cosmos is composed of an invisible creative force, called Wakonta, that is ever-changing within an ordered cosmos constructed with four major, interwoven divisions: sky, earth, day, and night. The sky is associated with north, the left side, and the male gender. Earth is allied with the south, the right side, and the female gender. Day is linked to the east, the sun, life, birth, the male gender, and the color red. Night is connected to the west, the moon, destruction, the female gender, and the color black. Regalia worn by the Osage people often symbolically reflect the complex elements of their cosmos.The kingfisher attached to the back of the headdress symbolically unites the Osage Sky and Earth people, since the bird flies in the sky and hunts in the water. The bird also unites the male (sky) and female (earth) forming the left and right side of the Osage universe. The northern harrier and red-tailed hawk feathers attached to the trailer are symbolic of the sun or life and give the hunter the power to move quickly and effectively.
 At the beginning of the twentieth century, upper-class Mangbetu women wore a small banana or plantain leaf bustle (called a negbe) in the back to cover their buttocks. The women appliqued delicately cut and colored pieces of leaves atop an oval pad built up of layered plantain leaves. A similar but smaller object (called a nogetwe) was worn in the front over a belt to fasten a piece of bark cloth in place as a frontal covering.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).

 ART OF PRESENTING GENDERArt can play a role in articulating and enacting gender identities, both openly and more subtly. This stool and figure display their respectively male and female bodily sexual characteristics quite directly. The stool would have been used by a Lobi man of high status, with its phallic “foot” protruding to convey his virility and authority. The figure, dedicated to the Yoruba cult of Shango, the orisha (god) of thunder, emphasizes female characteristics of breasts and hairdo. In addition, the bowl held by the figure has sexual and reproductive associations. The two headrests are everyday objects with the same function, though their differing forms are based on the gender of the user. The blocklike form of the man’s headrest contrasts with the more slender form of the woman’s. Even everyday objects such as these can subtly reinforce a strict, binary concept of gender. In addition to cradling the head and protecting often elaborate coiffures during sleep, headrests also serve as emblems of status.

 Mbra figures are carved in the form of a baboon. They are meant to serve as a means of contacting a spirit force. The spirit is believed to possess an individual and assist that person in divining the future. The baboon form is meant to shock, intimidate, and impress with the power of the wild. To honor the spirit, offerings of blood, eggs and millet beer are made to the figure, producing the encrusted surface of this piece.
 Ethiopian CrossesChristianity most likely arrived in Ethiopia in the first century. The conversion of King Ezana in 330 c.e. led to its official acceptance and the minting of coins bearing one of the earliest uses of the cross as a Christian symbol. Although the silver pendant crosses in the Museum’s collection are from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, their forms have a considerably longer history, as the much older copper, wood, and iron crosses here demonstrate.Hand crosses, which are used by priests, are either hand-held or suspended from a cord around the neck. They are kissed by the faithful to receive a blessing. Processional crosses are carried on long poles in religious processions. Prayer staffs are used to mark rhythms during sacred dances and as supports to lean on while standing for long hours during Orthodox church services. Together, all of these crosses are emblems of the Ethiopian Orthodox church’s ongoing authority.
 Raphael Soyer had a lifelong interest in the daily lives of working-class New Yorkers. His paintings of lone women in the early 1940s suggest the absence of husbands or sweethearts who had been called up to serve in World War II. Soyer liked to depict the blank expressions of people lost in thought, leaving the meaning of the scene open to the viewer’s own interpretation. Throughout his career, his subjects conveyed a sense of weariness and disquiet—a mood related to the social isolation of modern urban life.
 Flat Surfaces, Arthur G. Dove’s last major canvas, serves as a poignant summation of his longtime quest for the “elimination of the non-essential.” Basing the composition on the view of the pond from his Long Island home, he distilled the landscape into flat, hard-edged geometric shapes that approach pure abstraction. Though an intimate of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz’s circle of modern artists, Dove preferred to live and work outside the city in proximity to nature. Considered the first American artist to produce purely nonrepresentational pictures (in 1910), he used form and color to express his deep spiritual feelings about the natural world.
 Edward Hopper established his artistic reputation in the early twenties on the basis of his watercolors, particularly his bright but stark “portraits” of the Victorian houses of Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Deceptively simple, these works demonstrate Hopper’s talent for spare compositions, as well as his exceptional control of the washes with which he suggested the brilliant effects of coastal light. In 1923, the Brooklyn Museum was the first institution to purchase a Hopper watercolor—The Mansard Roof (23.69).
 Alma Hirsig Bliss was one of many women active in the miniature revival of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. She belonged to professional organizations, exhibited widely, and won awards for her work, which included landscapes and still lifes in addition to portraits. Exemplifying the expanded repertoire of subject matter that artists explored in the miniature format, this painting allowed Bliss to showcase her skill at capturing the material properties of a range of different objects.
 Samuel Yellin was one of the most important American metalworkers of the early twentieth century. He executed metalwork for the National Cathedral in Washington, D. C., and the New York Athletic Club and Temple Emanuel in New York. Unlike the other metal pieces exhibited here, this one was never installed in a building. Rather, it was a maquette (or study) and may have been the presentation piece shown to the architects of the Federal Reserve Bank in lower Manhattan (see illustration below) to help Yellin secure the commission. The final designs of the actual metalwork in the bank, which Yellin, in the Arts and Crafts tradition, executed by hand, are closely related. Yellin was not an architect as were the designers of the other metal pieces here; rather, the Renaissance Revival style of this grille was dictated by the bold Italian Renaissance style of the bank.
 Taking full advantage of pliable fiberglass, the Pedestal armchair’s flowing lines create a unified design statement that has led to its being nicknamed the “Tulip” chair. It is the culmination of Saarinen’s experiments with molded shell forms, begun in 1940 in a collaboration with Charles Eames. The chair the two designed that year for The Museum of Modern Art’s Organic Design in Home Furnishings exhibition won an award and set the stage for innovative mid-century furniture design.
 First manufactured by Knoll in 1952, the welded-steel-rod Diamond armchair by Harry Bertoia added dynamism to modern seating. Its open frame, supporting a grid of smaller diamond shapes, glorified the use of a new industrial material. Bertoia wrote about the graceful design: “My feeling was that it had to come almost from an inward direction. . . . I began to rely once more on my own body. . . . The chairs are studies in space, form, and metal, too.” The continued success of the Diamond armchair is attributable to its seamless melding of aesthetics and practicality, seen in the best mid-century American design.
 The Yekuana of Venezuela first acquired small European glass beads through trade with the Spanish explorers who arrived in the region in 1759 and established settlements on the lower Orinoco River. Before Western clothing became fashionable, the beaded apron was the most intricate item in a woman’s wardrobe, reserved for ceremonial occasions. The trapezoidal aprons in blue, red, and white—the most popular colors—usually have geometric designs along the upper and lower edges with solid-color beadwork in between.
 These two objects were probably parts of elaborate dressing table sets that included a handheld brush, mirror, combs, small boxes, and other accessories. When the hairbrush was made, the French Art Nouveau style was new and considered avant-garde. The dense, curvilinear floral design and the female head with long, curling tresses are characteristic of that style. A generation later, this taste for curvilinear naturalism was supplanted by the French Art Moderne (or Art Deco) style of the hand mirror. Here, nature is still invoked in the decoration, but it is rendered in a more schematic, hard-edged manner that appears more modern today.
 Becoming AgainMasquerade is a moment for play—a chance to invent and experiment, even within established social needs and existing mask genres. These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.The two Bobo works share a basic form—a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns—typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.The Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.
This terracotta figure of a woman was created by the San Francisco–based African American artist Sargent Johnson in the 1930s, when black artists were deriving powerful inspiration from the New Negro Movement and its leader Alain Locke. Locke’s particular encouragement of art that celebrated black physical types and African ancestral traditions led Johnson to refer to African sculpture in the masklike form of the face. Employing a modernist reduction of form in the simplified, cylindrical body, Johnson created a work that exudes a quiet gravity and power. At midcentury, Abstract Expressionist artists including Adolph Gottlieb (whose work hangs to the right) used African-inspired forms to achieve similar effects.
 In this satirical lithograph, Mabel Dwight contrasts the violin-playing little person, whose musical talent and physical difference are on display, with Mechano, the man with movie-star looks who acts like a robot. Popular in the late 1920s, automaton sideshow performances engaged audiences in the larger debate over the place of machines in society.
 This characteristic Tiffany "dragonfly"-design lampshade features predominantly amber and blue colors. The upper portion of the lampshade is veined; the lower portion is decorated with a band of dragonflies with outspread wings overlaid in pierced bronze encircling the perimeter.
 In this striking image of a mission church that Charles Hawthorne encountered on a trip to Texas and Mexico in 1928, he used watery washes to suggest a scene bathed in brilliant southwestern light. The vivid tonalities and rapid touch of Hawthorne’s mature work in watercolor (largely from the 1920s) stand in stark contrast to the oil paintings for which he was better known—figure subjects that tended to be dark and heavily brushed. He may have found inspiration for this more liberated expression in the freely brushed and vibrant watercolors of John Singer Sargent.
 Raphael Soyer approached pastel in a relatively conservative manner, entirely covering the paper with carefully modeled forms. Elements of this composition (including the strong vertical elements that break up the space), as well as the subject of dancers, make reference to the work of the French Impressionist and progressive pastellist Edgar Degas.
 This work characterizes the new approach to the portrait miniature during its twentieth-century renaissance. Unlike the sentimental, private objects of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, revival miniatures functioned as aesthetic objects in their own right. In addition, artists emulated contemporary trends in full-scale oil painting, including loose brushwork and an interest in allover decorative patterns. The Brooklyn Museum led the way in institutional collecting of modern miniatures with the 1931 acquisition of seventeen works; as a result, the Museum’s holdings are especially strong in revival examples.
 Harold Edgerton created this photo, one of the earliest color strobe pictures ever taken, in his studio/laboratory. The kicker clenches his fist in concentration; he can’t see the ball because the studio is in total darkness. The ball is caught in the instant before it starts moving through space, where it will expand and contract on its trajectory. Edgerton was famously patient and took many photographs of the same situation to achieve his desired pictorial effect.
 Without formal training, Harry Callahan became one of the twentieth century’s most influential photographers through his investigation of light, shadow, texture, and multiple exposures. In images of cities, landscapes, and intimate portraits (mostly of his wife, Eleanor, and his daughter, Barbara), he often experimented with graphic abstraction, always infused with a personal expression. This early portrait of Eleanor combines his exploration of light with his interest in line and form. Eleanor’s face is seen in profile against the trunk of a tree. Shadows of foliage overlay her face, and the stark contrasts contribute to the flatness of the image. The Museum holds several of Callahan’s portraits of Eleanor and Barbara, as well as many cityscapes and landscapes, a large number of them in color.
 In the wake of World War I, many artists in the United States and Europe abandoned modernist experiments with fractured human form to celebrate the idealized human body in ways that signaled postwar recovery and liberation. Maurice Sterne, who had experimented with modernism after encountering the work of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse in Paris from 1904 to 1907, also took a more idealized direction in The Awakening. The figure, based in part on the nudes of Michelangelo, shows sleek, modern proportions that blend classical art and a then-fashionable slim and athletic modern body type. This type of physique is a hallmark of the twenties style, as is the figure’s “strange combination of the masculine, feminine, and child,” as Sterne himself described it.
 U-shaped pieces, a by-product of early experiments with molding plywood, made it possible to construct this freestanding, adjustable, and easy-to-carry folding screen. Each panel is an undulating form. United by full-length canvas “hinges,” the panels suggest a succession of waves reaching the shoreline.The FSW screen proved labor-intensive to produce, and it was discontinued in 1956. The piece shown here is unusual for its ebonized veneer and ten-panel width, rather than the typical eight.
 In 1948, the husband-and-wife design team of Michael and Frances Higgins began producing glass using a technique in which warm, pliable sheets of glass were “slumped” over molds, decorated with bits of enamel, foil, or wire, and then sandwiched with more glass. In this dynamic piece, the walls of the bowl comprise enlarged cellular forms that look as if they may multiply at any moment.
 This folding lounge chair was made as the deck chair for the SS United States ocean liner, launched in 1952. The ship, which soon achieved the record for the fastest Atlantic crossing, cost a staggering seventy-eight million dollars and was noteworthy for its extensive use of aluminum and its modern décor. The Troy Sunshade Company was an American firm that pioneered the manufacture of tubular steel furniture in the 1930s and then aluminum furniture in the postwar period. Hundreds of these chairs were made for the liner and remained with the ship until 1984, when the fittings and furniture were auctioned. The ship is now docked in Philadelphia awaiting refurbishment.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 This iconic pitcher was famously inspired by the prow of the legendary Normandie ocean liner, which quickly became the epitome of modernity. The interiors of this speedy ship were designed by the leading French proponents of the Art Moderne, or Art Deco, style, characterized by hard-edged silhouettes and stylized decoration.
 Marsden Hartley occasionally painted imaginary portraits of historical figures such as this one of John Donne, the seventeenth-century English metaphysical poet and dean of Saint Paul’s Cathedral in London. The solemn portrait is based on an engraving of Donne’s carved tomb effigy that was the frontispiece for a collection of his sermons. The shrouded body is presented in a palette of blues and whites, cool colors evocative of death, while the striated pattern of folds approximates the hard, carved stone of the tomb.
 Although best known as an abstract sculptor, Claire Falkenstein was also an innovative jewelry maker. In fact, she considered jewelry so important that she insisted that it be shown along with her large-scale sculptures throughout her career. Her jewelry was included in several seminal modern jewelry exhibitions such as the 1948 "Second National Exhibition of Contemporary Jewelry" in Minneapolis. This piece by her shown here was evidently especially valued by the artist and remained in her possession until she died.
 In the 1930s, Aaron Siskind explored a variety of social issues in documentary-style images and created the series Harlem Document (selections from which are represented in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection). His work became abstract and metaphoric in the early 1940s, and he cultivated friendships with such Abstract Expressionist painters as Franz Kline, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, and Mark Rothko. Siskind’s photographs of graffiti, peeling plaster, sections of signs, road surfaces, and found objects marked a decisive shift in his work; exploring the properties of the medium, he flattened the picture plane, paid close attention to tonal gradation, and often drastically cropped the image. Gloucester 16A was made during a prolific period in Gloucester, Massachusetts, during the summers of 1944 and 1945. In many photographs from the Gloucester series, the shapes are unrecognizable and the shallow space is extremely compressed. This image elevates a simple section of wall into a totemic figure. Like a strange, rural Rorschach blot, the circular opening, a black void, suggests both an eye and a peephole.
 In Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, regions that acquired great wealth from the mining and trading of gold, chiefs and other people of status displayed their standing by wearing a profusion of gold ornaments, even attaching such objects to umbrellas and swords. Although many of these ornaments are abstract geometric shapes, some represent human faces or animals, including those shown here depicting a sawfish or antelope. Such works were made using the lost-wax casting method, in which a clay mold was made around a modeled wax form. The mold was then heated and the wax poured out. Finally, molten gold was poured into the mold to create a form in the shape of the original wax model.
 Today aluminum is taken for granted as a lightweight, inexpensive material that has many applications. However, it was only in 1886 that an American, Charles Martin Hall, discovered the process that made its commercial production possible. Over the next forty years, aluminum evolved from a laboratory curiosity to an industrial staple.
 Mangbetu men and women of high status traditionally wore hats made of fiber with a circular base and a rectangular or hexagonal top. They were decorated with feathers, usually from birds found in the high forest areas, but occasionally from domestic fowl, as in this example.
 Sol LeWitt was a mentor to many younger artists and writers. He was so significant to Lippard’s thinking that she dedicated Six Years to him. While his own practice always led to materialized works, he defined his artistic method as Conceptual, because he would always start from an idea, often permutations of a basic form or repetition of an operation, which he called the “machine that makes the art.” These two sketches show him elaborating the multiple forms of open cubes, and some of the various configurations possible for parallel straight lines.
 ART OF DOUBLESDuality is present in art throughout the continent as an expression of essential concepts that drive human nature—from gender to humanity’s place in the cosmos. This pair of pairs illustrates some of the ways that artists have expressed these ideas. Ere ibeji are carved by the Yoruba primarily as memorial figures for twins. Because twins are considered spiritually powerful beings, with power to provide considerable good or to inflict harm, ibeji figures are the focus of great personal interaction and care. Such figures are considered a point of access to the spirit of a departed twin, and an icon of status for a mother of twins. Worn on the heads of male dancers, ci-wara headdresses are danced in male and female pairs to symbolize the fertility of land and animals. Each headdress represents an antelope, which for the Bamana is a metaphor for the successful farmer who tirelessly tills his fields.
 Only initiates of the Koma men’s society may see the figure of the koma ba, which dances in the village to attract evil spirits that roam the bush at night. Koma ba masks are composed of a human face with a beak extending from the chin and wooden horns on the head. The horns are filled with substances that protect the wearer from sorcerer spells. The mask is heavily encrusted with blood and with chewed and expectorated kola nut; in addition, X-rays show a miniature metal bow and an arrow point as well as rifle-shell casings beneath the surface materials, all of which increase the power of the mask.

 Hospitality is an important virtue in African societies. Among the Dan, the woman with the greatest reputation for hospitality is known as a wunkirle. On public occasions, she carries as a staff of office a spoon known as a wunkirmian. The large bowl of the spoon suggests the ample quantities of rice she has given away. The ram's head commonly denotes power among the Dan, but it may also refer to the use of rams as sacrifices at the feasts over which a wunkirle presides.
 At a time when there were few professional African American artists, Nancy Elizabeth Prophet trained at the Rhode Island School of Design and carved powerful sculptures in hardwood, such as Untitled (Head). The artist, who endured decades of poverty and hunger in order to pursue her career, produced works characterized by somber dignity and idealized but expressive facial features. This sculpture is one of only about a dozen known works by Prophet still in existence.
 Consuelo Kanaga, one of the pioneers of modern American photography, began her career as a photojournalist in 1915 in San Francisco. In the 1920s, Alfred Stieglitz inspired her to develop a more aesthetic approach, and a trip to Europe in 1928 awakened her lifelong preoccupation with European modernist painting and the ways in which that work was influenced by the sculpture of Africa. Kanaga successfully combined a Pictorialist aesthetic with a realist strategy, producing handsomely composed and carefully printed images. She was one of few white American photographers in the 1930s to make artistic portraits of African Americans.In Frances with a Flower, the focus is so sharp that the slightly rough texture of the woman’s skin, shiny with perspiration at the hairline, seems palpable. The forehead, nose, and cheeks, highlighted by flash, contrast with the deep-set eyes lost in shadow, thus producing a sculptural dimension that turns the photograph into hills and valleys of light. The stark white blossom pressed to the woman’s nose emphasizes the sensuality of her face.The Brooklyn Museum held large retrospective exhibitions of Kanaga’s work in 1976 and 1993 and holds several hundred of her images in its collection.
 Depicting a cluster of smokestacks, ducts, and pipes on an ocean liner, this drawing features the kinds of mechanical and industrial imagery embraced by Precisionist artists as icons of modern America. A style that arose in the 1920s, Precisionism was characterized by simplified geometric forms and an absence of human beings. Here George Copeland Ault cropped the view of the ship’s machinery in order to focus attention on the aesthetic potential of his subject—the play of rounded and linear shapes and dark and light tones—rather than its practical function.
 After encountering French Cubism in Paris, Charles Demuth produced a large body of still-life and architectural watercolors based in a Cubist-inspired faceting of forms. Particularly drawn to the small-town American architecture of his native Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he continued to spend a significant amount of time, Demuth transposed the architectural volumes into two-dimensional designs of selected planes set off by precisely ruled lines. Within these compositions, the tones and density of his washes suggest spatial depth while areas of unpainted paper reassert the two-dimensional surface.
 The kifwebe masquerade is a genre shared by the Luba and Songye, indicative of the interaction that has occurred between the two societies. Kifwebe masks represent either male or female beings. Both mask types are characterized by angular and thrusting forms, and in both cases the entire face is covered in patterns of geometric grooves that are uniquely characteristic of these masks. Female masks, such as this one, are distinguished by the predominant use of white clay and the rounded form of the head crest.
 Although Francois Jourdain was known primarily as a painter, he was also an accomplished designer and a founding member of the Union des Artistes Modernes, an important group of avant-garde designers. This adjustable chair is rendered in the Art Moderne style, which is characterized by simple, bold curves. The use of exotic mahogany and cane alludes to the French colonial empire, still partially intact during this period. The chair was manufactured by Jourdain’s own firm, Les Ateliers Modernes.
 Blanche Lazzell made this group of objects—part of a larger suite of fourteen works—as an artistic exercise while studying in Paris with the Cubist Albert Gleizes. They provide a fascinating glimpse into Lazzell’s process of transforming a townscape into an abstract composition. The graphite drawings show her progression from a relatively representational image of an urban plaza with buildings, stairways, and trees to ever more reductive, abstract shapes that she rearranged and filled with different patterns and tones, culminating in the watercolor. This kind of experimentation allowed Lazzell to explore the expressive possibilities of abstraction, in keeping with Gleizes’s theories that the juxtaposition of flat forms—through their relation to each other and the paper surface—provides a new way to signify spatial depth.

 This spare graphite drawing of a female nude torn from a spiral notebook is one of hundreds that Louise Nevelson created—almost compulsively—between 1929 and 1934, early in her artistic career, when she was experimenting with different media. Incorporating large areas of blank paper, her reductive and distorted treatment of human anatomy emphasizes the two-dimensionality of the picture plane. This flattening effect is counterbalanced, however, by the dynamism of her jagged line and the figure’s monumentality.
 "LUNA": This single word was enough to signal to any early twentieth-century viewer that he was looking at an image of the mechanized wonder of Coney Island. The Russian-born Louis Lozowick was one of many modern artists drawn to the exciting light show of Coney Island's Luna Park, known as the Electric Eden. He combined cropped and abstracted elements of this leisure mecca's most famous attractions, including the Ferris wheel, the steeplechase ridge, and exotic illuminated minarets.
 Like many modernist portraits, this drawing displays dynamic tensions between illusionistic three-dimensionality and the flatness of the paper support, between representation and abstraction, and between individualization and idealization. George Ault reduced the forms of the head into simplified shapes, creating passages of shading that contrast starkly with the large areas of blank paper.
 ART OF SATIREMasks are particularly useful for expressing disapproval and thus reinforcing communal values. These two masks performed instructional and critical messages about proper behavior and political discontent. Male Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. This mask depicts a French gendarme, a colonial soldier, and was most likely performed as a critique of French personal and political behavior during the colonial period. The mask depicting Elvis Presley belonged to the Nyau society (to which all Chewa men belong), an institution that governs the spiritual realm of death and the ancestors. The society’s masks always represent the spirits of the deceased, but they may also represent wild bush spirits or caricature personalities from the wider community. Outsiders—including Swahili slave traders, British officials, the Virgin Mary, and other iconic foreigners such as Elvis Presley— have been considered representative of antisocial traits and undesirable values.
 As an homage to Paul Cézanne, the modernist Marsden Hartley spent a period living and working in the French artist’s favorite landscape, Aix-en- Provence, in the South of France. As Cézanne had done, Hartley depicted the distinctive profile of Mont Sainte-Victoire repeatedly. In this spare drawing, he captured the stark monumentality and sculptural contours of the mountain while using a flatter and more economical treatment for the foreground valley, where he incorporated large areas of blank paper and rendered structures in faceted planes that evoke Cézanne’s style. Although Hartley was working in front of the natural motif, he envisioned this landscape through the lens of Cézanne’s art.
 Katherine Dreier, who was president of the Société Anonyme (an organization of avant-garde artists), believed in art's potential to shape our lives. She promoted her ideas not only in such paintings as Unknown Forces, but also in essays in which she asserted that her work referred to "new cosmic forces coming to the fore which in time [would] . . .  change our vision of life as well as that of Art. "
 Beauford Delaney arranged this still-life composition as if to represent an offering to the Fang reliquary figure that appears at the right. His vivid colors and the energetic brushwork create a sense of vibration—the bowl almost appears to spin, and the figure to rock. Delaney may have seen traditional African art at the Primitive African Art Center in Manhattan or at the Brooklyn Museum.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 This exuberant ink drawing conveys the powerful energy and voluptuous eroticism of the female nude—a favorite subject of the modernist sculptor Gaston Lachaise. Here he reduced the body to a flattened outline of sinuous curves, relying on the expressive quality of his line to animate the figure. Inspired by his wife and muse, Lachaise presented a new feminine ideal that endowed the classical Venus type with modernist forms and earthy sexuality.
 Unlike many American Scene painters, Paul Sample was associated with multiple regions (Southern California and New England) and both urban and rural subjects. His pictures were highly regarded for their powerfully direct compositions that, like this barren scene, often struck a note of Depression-era melancholy. As one Art News critic observed in 1934, “[Sample] paints simply and conservatively, omitting startling devices . . . and unusual fabrications of color. There is a frank open quality to his work which is rather winning after much current showmanship and affectation.”
 One of the younger Precisionist artists, Edmund Lewandowski celebrated the industrialized landscapes of his native Midwest. In this watercolor, he reduced the factory structures of the Allis-Chalmers complex (an agricultural machinery manufactory outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin) to a flattened, abstracted arrangement of geometric shapes. Despite its limited palette and lack of a human presence, Industrial Composition evinces a sense of vitality through the syncopated patterns of lines and planes.
 By the time he immigrated to the United States in 1932, George Grosz had spent a decade painting shocking figure subjects that indicted the dissipated society and corrupt regime of Weimar Germany and led to his condemnation by Hitler’s Nazi government. Once in this country, Grosz freed himself to paint landscapes and took up watercolor. In that medium he began to experience the pure pleasure of painting with a liberated, almost calligraphic touch bearing no relation to the lurid tones and laboriously worked surfaces of his German oil paintings.
 Embracing a subject that corresponded to the natural "life" of white alabaster, the Brooklynite Robert Laurent here worked his design onto the stone surface, almost magically implying the continuation of the forms within the rock mass. In keeping with direct-carving ideals, requiring direct contact with the raw, natural material, he then hand-polished the surface to raise a brilliance and translucency from the naturally chalky stone.
 
 In the mid-1930s Mark Rothko began a series of works with subjects derived from the urban experience that became known as the Subway series. These paintings reflect the artist's sense of isolation, shared by many at the time, that resulted from the harsh social conditions caused by the Great Depression. Although figurative, these paintings accentuate the geometry underlying the elements of the city's infrastructure and thus prefigure Rothko's later concentration on rectangular shapes of luminous colors in his celebrated abstract paintings.
 The Danish-born modernist Kai Gotzsche painted this work in the American Southwest, where he spent time in the 1920s, often in the company of the writer D. H. Lawrence and a fellow Danish painter, Knud Merrild, at the Taos home of the art patron Mabel Dodge. Abstracted in a decorative manner, with simplified forms and echoes of a few key shapes, the composition is in keeping with the elegant Art Deco style that was internationally popular by the mid-1920s, particularly in architecture, decorative arts, and graphics.
 Like his teacher Charles Hawthorne, John Whorf developed as a watercolorist under the powerful influence of John Singer Sargent, whose works were frequently exhibited in the United States throughout the first decades of the twentieth century—most notably at the Brooklyn Museum. In this image of a sun-dappled cabin in rural Tennessee, Whorf emulated Sargent’s use of freely brushed washes to describe the colorful tints of shifting shadows. Sargent apparently approved of Whorf’s direction, purchasing a watercolor from the young man’s first solo exhibition, in Boston, in 1924.
 Both of these photographs, depicting portraits of royal officers and officials, have been attributed to Antoin Sevruguin, who served as a court photographer to Nasir al-Din Shah. Sevruguin’s photographic portraits are often recognized by a skillful manipulation of light and a keen attention to capturing aspects of the sitter’s personality.The portraits reveal some of the effects of Iran’s exposure to European culture in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. The two soldiers’ uniforms suggest how Iranian costume gradually incorporated European modes of dress. At right, Mirza Husayn Khan and Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir, the famed prime minister to Nasir al-Din Shah (later executed by the same ruler), are shown posing in elegant European suits. Their powerful political positions are countered by Sevruguin’s use of soft light.
 Bavarian-born Hans Hofmann settled in New York in the late 1930s. During the 1940s he became a devoted and influential teacher, especially of the first and second generations of Abstract Expressionists. In Towering Spaciousness, the artist combines strictly defined geometric forms with thickly applied, gestural areas of orange, blue, yellow, pink, and green. Blocks of color are built into towering spatial intervals. Indeed this painting well represents the artist's "push-and-pull" theory. In considering the spatial relations he created on the picture plane, Hofmann wrote in 1948: "Push and pull are expanding and contracting forces which are activated by carriers in visual motion. Planes are the most important carriers, lines and point less so."
 Although a Western form, this chest of drawers is decorated with Asian materials, bamboo and cane. At the 1876 Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia, Japan showed furniture made of these materials, and American merchants subsequently imported or made here in Brooklyn, but it is evocative indicator of the appeal of Japanism to the American market and the melding of Western and Eastern cultures.
 In Seated Faun, Janet Scudder took as inspiration the part-human, part-goat figure found in classical mythology. One of only a handful of internationally known female sculptors in America at the time, Scudder studied in Paris and became the first woman employed at the Paris studio of the sculptor Frederick MacMonnies. She later made a name for herself crafting ornamental sculptures for the formal gardens of estates designed by the architect Stanford White. Admired by White, whose firm designed the Brooklyn Museum, Scudder was even selected as the only female to produce a sculpture, Japanese Art, for the Museum’s facade.
 In this studio portrait, the Brooklyn artist Harry Edwards painted the Native American Handsome Morning, wearing a fringed shift with painted emblems, a bead-and-quill necklace, beaded moccasins, and a ceremonial blanket of fur-lined buffalo hide painted with abstract motifs (a speciality of Dakota women). Edward's identification of his sitter as a Dakota, or a Sioux, is meaningful because the Sioux retained perhaps the most lasting hold on white imaginations owing to the charismatic Ghost Dance movement. Inspired by the visions of a Paiute Indian, a wave of the Sioux communities began the practice of the Ghost Dance in the late nineteenth century to bring about the return of legions of their dead and of Sioux lands to their natural state. White fears of the movement's emotional force ultimately led to the murder of Sitting Bull and the violent confrontation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1890.
 Active in the modernist art circles of New York City during the 1920s and 1930s, George Ault moved upstate to Woodstock in 1937 for health reasons. He transferred his Precisionist idiom—with its simplified geometric forms and flat planes of color—from its usual urban industrial subjects to the rural landscape. In contrast to the cool objectivity of images by his Precisionist colleagues such as Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth, Ault’s works often resonate with melancholic emotion, evident here in the dead trees, barren field, and moody sky.
Inspired by the imposing architectural profiles and irrepressible energy of New York City, Joseph Stella completed his first painting of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1920 and returned to the theme a number of times in succeeding years. Stella used pastel as an experimental mode in which to work out his denser and highly finished modernist abstractions in oil.
 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer. Seedpod rattles and metal bells added a musical aspect to the performance.Although they are danced by Luvale men, mwana pwevo masks depict women. In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.
 Jacques Lipchitz, who had fled war-torn Paris and emigrated to America in 1941, met the modernist painter Marsden Hartley in 1942. He recalled his eagerness to do a portrait of Hartley, whose face he considered "typically American" and "very sensitive." This penetrating portrayal was done the year before Hartley's death at sixty-six and poignantly captures the painter's age and melancholy. The monumentality of the profile is in marked contrast to the wasted and drawn features of the frontal view, with its tragic overtones. Lipchitz commented that this brooding likeness of a fellow artist had been "made for myself as an exercise and demonstration." In fact, it required twenty-seven life sittings to complete Hartley's portrait. This cast, one of seven, belonged to the collectors Edith and Milton Lowenthal, who also left the Museum a rich legacy of nine paintings by Marsden Hartley.
 Louis Bouché’s portrait of the three Stettheimer sisters—from left to right, Florine, Carrie, and Ettie—evokes the whimsical decorative style and material opulence of their New York apartment, the site of a salon frequented by Bouché, Marcel Duchamp, and other figures of the artistic vanguard. Although he treated forms in a simplified and Cubist manner, Bouché imbued each of his sitters with a unique personality, conveying their eccentricity and independence. Florine was herself a successful artist, Ettie was a writer, and Carrie was a hostess and creator of a dollhouse replica of the Stettheimer home (Museum of the City of New York).
 Beginning in the late 1920s, Arthur Dove created abstract compositions inspired by natural forms and forces that he believed would be understood intuitively by the viewer. By the 1930s he was working out his compositions in this type of small-scale washes and then executed his ink drawing over them to lend a degree of clarity to the abstracted areas of color. Here a white form with a black mark suggests a dwelling near a wooded shoreline.
 The lively animation of Dong Kingman’s watercolors derives in part from his training in classical Chinese painting and calligraphy. Kingman was born in Oakland, California, to Chinese immigrants but was raised in Hong Kong, where he studied Asian and Western painting techniques. Returning to the United States during the Depression, he worked with a Works Progress Administration art program and gained wider exposure for his art, which tended to be scenic in subject.
 This female figure illustrates the ability of Dogon sculptors to translate the human form into geometric volumes. In profile, the figure's neckline, breasts, belly, buttocks, and legs are a series of diagonal lines.
 These large keystones of male heads wearing garlands of grapevines represent satyrs (mythological creatures that are part human and part animal) or, perhaps, Bacchus, the god of wine in classical mythology. Their lively visages once adorned the facade of the Park Lane Hotel at Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Streets in Manhattan. The fourteen-story building was demolished in 1966.
 The Tsogho, like other groups in Gabon, construct bundles, often decorated with carved figures, to contain the remains of important ancestors and other powerful materials. Among the Tsogho, these bundles commemorate specific ancestors. Periodically, offerings are made to the reliquary, or boumba bwiti, to honor the ancestor and other members of the lineage. Families may also use the figures during initiations.
 George Benjamin Luks occasionally painted formal portraits such as this one of the fifteen-year-old Antoinette Kraushaar (1902--1992), who posed in her grammar school graduation dress. Although her father was a respected art dealer (she followed him in the profession), she had never actually seen an artist at work before sitting for Luks. She later recalled,  "It was very interesting because you could see how he would put a strong stroke in the painting--I couldn't see the painting, but I could see him as he worked on it. At one point he said there was an awful lot of white, so he went around the studio and came up with a dusty piece of blue linen that he draped over my shoulder."
 Kuba mythology revolves around three figures, each represented by a masquerade character: Woot, the creator and founder of the ruling dynasty; Woot’s spouse; and Bwoom. Bwoom’s specific identity varies according to different versions of the myth. He may represent the king’s younger brother, a person of Twa descent, or a commoner. Embodying a subversive force within the royal court, the Bwoom masquerade is often performed in conflict with the masked figure representing Woot.
 Several types of masks are used in dances celebrating the emergence of young initiates from the Yaka circumcision camp, where boys are ritually received into Yaka manhood. Initiates hold n-khanda masks like this one to celebrate their new status as men.
 In this hand-carved work, the French-born Brooklyn artist Robert Laurent formed three organic and erotic leaf forms that stretch upward with a turning or unfurling motion suggested by the complex interplay of their silhouettes. Throughout the 1920s artists often engaged living, natural forms as surrogates for the human body in works that celebrated physical presence as an antidote to modern, mechanized lives. Among his earliest freestanding sculptures (Laurent had previously carved frames and two-dimensional reliefs), this work is one of a small handful of plant and flame subjects by the artist.
 In this drawing William Zorach abstracted the forms of a large tree and three nude figures into schematized shapes outlined with borders of parallel hatchings. The uniform treatment of humans and landscape points to the harmonious relationship he felt with nature on his annual summer retreats into the countryside. As he recalled of these idylls, “There were no problems . . . no gloomy forebodings, no literary solving of the world’s ills, only a joyous awareness of the world about us.” In addition, this drawing presents a modernist take on the traditional theme of bathers in the landscape.
 This type of egungun costume is found throughout the Oyo region of southwestern Nigeria. It consists of a length of wood balanced on the head, from which panels of cloth are suspended. Its great rectangular form completely conceals the human body, transforming the costumed wearer into a returned ancestor.Because the cloths composing the costume are of great value and prestige, they enhance the status of the families associated with the masks. The mask embodies the spirits of the ancestral dead, who reenter the community annually in swirling, whirling moments of high drama and spiritual significance.
 Beginning in 1947, Ruth Adler began designing simple modern fabrics for home furnishing. Swizzles is an example of her lively work and may take its name from the ubiquitous “swizzle stick” stuck into many a 1950s cocktail glass. The textile is full of the organic patterning that would become a hallmark of the era’s aesthetic.Adler arrived in Michigan in the mid-1940s to attend the Cranbrook Academy of Art and never left the Detroit area. Together with her husband, Edward Schnee, she established a studio and retail outlet devoted to bringing good design to the city. It was, however, her work as a textile designer for which she is best known.
 The photographer Ben Ross took this aerial view of Coney Island on July 4, 1946. The following day, the New York Times reported that 1.3 million people had visited the resort, the largest crowd in its history, to celebrate the holiday.
 This figure has been attributed to the workshop of the renowned Yoruba carver Toibo, of the town of Erin. It was probably carved in the 1920s or 1930s for the timi (king) of Ede (one of the historic Yoruba kingdoms), who kept it in a shrine dedicated to the orisha (god) Shango. Equestrian figures are potent symbols of power in many parts of Africa where ownership of horses was long restricted to warriors and political leaders. In Yoruba mythology, Shango was both a king and the orisha associated with thunder and lightning.
 The Kota believe that the bones of important men and women retain power after death, providing protection and good fortune to an individual's descendants. The bones are preserved in reliquaries made of bark or basketry. On top are placed figures known as bwiti. This bwiti typifies the Kota style. The face is covered with strips of hammered brass and copper. The neck swells into an open lozenge shape, the lower part of which is thrust into the container of bones forming its "body."
 The urban realist Reginald Marsh depicted modern New York life—burlesque theaters, crowded subways, popular beaches—in a variety of media. Watercolor allowed him to work quickly, a manner that he had developed as a newspaper and magazine illustrator. In this picture, Marsh used both dry and wet washes: note how he blurred the outline of the locomotive by letting wet paints bleed into each other in order to convey the sense of the train’s velocity as it speeds through the landscape.
 An important aspect of male competition in the Marquesas Islands, stilt games were either group races or individual competitions in which one opponent attempted to knock the stilts out from under his rival. Oral traditions record that some performers were so skilled that they were able to turn somersaults as they tested their athletic ability. During certain religious events, however, stilt demonstrations also measured a man's spiritual strength. Stilts were composed of a step attached with ornamental lashings to a shaft between five and seven feet long.
 A devoted modernist, landscape painter, and watercolorist, John Marin created compositions of partial forms—the essential elements of a view—using a rough charcoal sketch and passages of directionally applied watercolor washes that together suggest light and movement. He routinely allowed substantial areas of the paper support to remain unpainted—a technique that was usually less successful in his oils, in which he left areas of unpainted canvas exposed.
 Paul Strand was a pupil of Lewis Wickes Hine, who encouraged Strand to turn his hobby into his life’s work. After a visit to Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery in New York, Strand dedicated himself to the modernist aesthetic. Although his early interests focused on urban sites and machinery, eventually he turned to nature and portraiture in his search for purity of vision. His simple, straightforward portraits gradually became a quest for ideal beauty, seen in the inherent dignity of his subjects. Strand left the United States in the early 1950s to escape McCarthyism and lived in France for the rest of his life. He also travelled widely and spent long periods of time in Italy, the Outer Hebrides, Egypt, and Ghana. Strand turned experiences from his trips into photographic books, in which he tried to encapsulate the distinctive character of the places and the people he photographed. In this portrait from Egypt of Sheik Ali Gournah, Strand sought a precise vision of character through contrast, texture, and light. This technique expresses what he termed “an aesthetic based on the objective nature of reality.”
 To express the physical and spiritual bond between two individuals, sculptors devised a form called the pair statue. The most common variety showed the subjects—a husband and wife, a mother and child, or a king and a divinity, for example—seated together on a chair or bench. The earliest documented examples date to the reign of King Djoser in the Third Dynasty (circa 2675–2625 B.C.).This New Kingdom pair statue represents a married couple. The inscription tells us that the man is Nebsen, a scribe in the royal treasury, and the woman is Nebet-ta, a singer in the temple of the goddess Isis. They each pass one arm behind the other, a symbol closeness. In order to convey this sentiment and to create a harmonious design, the sculptor extended the arms to unnatural lengths.
 At a wide range of Baule festivals and celebrations, masks are danced and performed to entertain. This mask's delicate, symmetrical features, ornate hairstyle, and smooth surface all create an image of calm and grace. The mask is meant to exemplify an ideal of personal beauty and composure.
 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer.

 This mask blends features of a hornbill bird, or kuma, with the horn of a buffalo, or tu, combining animals associated with great wisdom and danger. Men wearing such masks perform at the initiation rites to men’s societies, at the funerals of important male elders, and at annual harvest ceremonies. The fact that this mask has only one buffalo horn may indicate that its design was transferred between clans, in which case the original form, with two horns, would have been slightly altered.
 This mask combines human features and those of a crocodile or shark with teeth bared. It has the tail of a chameleon, the horns and ears of an antelope, and features of less identifiable animals. Worn horizontally on top of the head, the mask is attached to a skirt of vegetal fibers that covers the body of the wearer. Banda masks were the property of the Simo men’s society, which historically oversaw and regulated fertility and initiation ceremonies. Today it is danced primarily for entertainment.
 Designed by the New York office of the Parisian decorating firm Alavoine, this elegant study, made for an elite client, was a conservative interpretation of the Art Deco style; this can be seen in the geometric paneling of palisander and olive wood veneers and the large abstract lacquer panel, designed by Henri Redard and executed by Jean Dunand. A small, concealed bar, with etched glass walls that salute France, is hidden in the corner in defiance of Prohibition, which forbade alcohol consumption in the United States from 1919 to 1933. Interestingly, while this room was furnished in the Art Deco style, the public rooms in the rest of the Worgelt apartment were furnished in a more conservative French eighteenth-century-revival style.
 Kananginak, son of Eegyvudluk Pootoogook, made this print from a drawing by his father. The subject alludes to Inuit knowledge of the interconnected workings of their environment. This print was included in the first graphics collection produced by Cape Dorset Graphics of the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, an organization created to promote Inuit art. An exhibition of the first thirty-nine prints toured Canada and the United States to great critical acclaim in 1959, leading to a continuation of the printmaking program, which is still active today.
 Osuitok Ipeelee created this lively print of four musk oxen racing across the frozen tundra. It was part of the first graphics collection produced by Cape Dorset Graphics of the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, an organization started by James Houston (an artist and Northern Services Officer of the Canadian government) in 1959 to secure recognition of Inuit artists and economic opportunities for Native people. The prints of the collection were produced by an Inuit committee from drawings submitted by Native men and women. The first exhibition of thirty-nine prints toured Canada and the United States to great critical acclaim, leading to a continuation of the printmaking program, which is still active today.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 ART OF DOUBLESDuality is present in art throughout the continent as an expression of essential concepts that drive human nature—from gender to humanity’s place in the cosmos. This pair of pairs illustrates some of the ways that artists have expressed these ideas. Ere ibeji are carved by the Yoruba primarily as memorial figures for twins. Because twins are considered spiritually powerful beings, with power to provide considerable good or to inflict harm, ibeji figures are the focus of great personal interaction and care. Such figures are considered a point of access to the spirit of a departed twin, and an icon of status for a mother of twins. Worn on the heads of male dancers, ci-wara headdresses are danced in male and female pairs to symbolize the fertility of land and animals. Each headdress represents an antelope, which for the Bamana is a metaphor for the successful farmer who tirelessly tills his fields.
 The V-form is a recurring motif in O’Keeffe’s art and in her wardrobe. In this painting, she has pushed the composition in the direction of abstraction by cropping the tree forms abruptly at the canvas’s edge, bringing focus to the V formed by the converging tree trunks. This V, painted in New Mexico a few months after Stieglitz’s death, may also be endowed with personal meaning. The two sets of bare tree trunks, rooted to each other in the ground but grown apart, may be a subtle reference to her partnership with Stieglitz, frayed by the end of his life because of his attentions to another woman.This painting can be seen hanging in O’Keeffe’s Ghost Ranch studio in the 1948 short film by Henwar Rodakiewicz, Land of Enchantment: Southwest U.S.A, on view nearby.
 Aerodynamic streamlining is characteristic of much American industrial and domestic design of the late 1920s and 1930s. Undecorated, curved designs, as seen here, are well suited to machine production and expressive of speed and change. The vanity and stool are made of chromed metal tubing, an innovation in furniture construction pioneered in the early 1920s by Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus, the seminal German school for modern design. It was still a startling new material a decade later. Although the vanity is gender-specific, this stark, modern interpretation has a limited palette and is made of new materials with hard surfaces. Updating an old form, Kem Weber transformed it for the modern woman.
 
 
 Although Pyrex glass, able to resist high levels of heat, had been invented as long ago as 1915, the Silver Streak iron put it to a new use. Metal shortages during World War II led to experiments not only with new materials, but also with new uses of old materials. Pyrex seemed the perfect replacement for metal in a household iron. Moreover, moldable glass allowed the handle of the Silver Streak to conform to the user’s hand, illustrating again the interest in ergonomics—the study of the way things work with the body—among designers of this time. Unfortunately, although Pyrex stood up well to heat, the bright colors inside did not, and the Silver Streak was not produced for very long.
 One of the leading figures of American Scene painting, Thomas Hart Benton traveled throughout the United States seeking what he perceived to be authentically American subject matter. After watching a rodeo in Wyoming, he made this watercolor, which provided the basis for a vignette in The Arts of Life in America, a monumental mural cycle installed at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1932. In the watercolor, Benton’s undulating lines and loose brushstrokes convey the energetic struggle between the horses and cowboys.
 From 1937 until his death, Marsden Hartley painted annually in his native state of Maine, returning each year to a landscape that he described as "strong, simple, stately" and "brutal." He adopted a boldly expressionistic, deliberately "primitive" style to convey his powerful response to this rugged, forbidding landscape. In Ghosts of the Forest, random piles of driftwood, bleached into pale, spectral shapes by exposure to the elements, dominate the foreground.
 Body Language The bold, open pose of the woman in Evening indicates that she is actively encouraging her partner’s attention. In contrast, the confidence man, or con man, in the adjacent painting stands aggressively near his female companion. His almost threatening stance and her downcast face suggest that he is not to be trusted. Despite the physical closeness of these two sets of figures, their faces are inscrutable and the nature of their interactions remains ambiguous. Guy Pène du Bois frequently painted stiff figures with masklike faces, suggesting social alienation beneath the glitter and gloss of the party scene.
 The modish hairstyle, form-fitting dress, and brazenly casual pose help to identify this sitter as a flapper—the name given to liberated young American women during the Roaring Twenties. Guy Pène du Bois is said to have found his inspiration for this painting in the work of another chronicler of the era, F. Scott Fitzgerald. The writer’s 1922 short story “Gretchen’s Forty Winks” featured the character Gretchen Halsey, “a bright-colored, Titian-haired girl, vivid as a French rag doll.”
 Tobacco was imported from Japan in exchange for marine products and furs. Among other imported goods were rice wine (sake) and rice.
 This depiction of a woman's head framed against a window is an example of Alfred Henry Maurer's late style--a striking, abstract mixture of linear and painterly elements. Late in his career, in poor health and emotionally drained because of negative reviews of his work, Maurer returned to this subject frequently, as if trying to solve the persistent aesthetic problem in his art: the balance between figuration and abstraction.
 In 1912 Stanton MacDonald-Wright and his colleague Morgan Russell invented the term Synchromy to refer to their experiments in making abstract compositions whose primary emphasis was on color. Although both artists were inspired by Cubism, they set out to reassert the importance of color in relationship to line in the creation of form.
 The rows of little hills under the Ram’s Head at Ghost Ranch must have been formed by thousands of years of wind and rain.… I had looked out on the hills for weeks and painted them again and again—had climbed and ridden over them—so beautifully soft, so difficult.… I had painted those hills from the car in bright sunlight and had failed dismally but I could see them—farther away—from my window in the rain. So I tried again. They seemed right with the Ram’s Head.… I don’t remember where I picked up the head—or the hollyhock. Flowers were planted among the vegetables in the garden between the house and the hills and I probably picked the hollyhock one day as I walked past. My paintings sometimes grow by pieces from what is around.—Georgia O’Keeffe, 1976In the mid-1930s, O’Keeffe’s frame maker George Of made scalloped and punched sheet metal frames for some of her paintings. These were inspired by vernacular traditions in tin ware made by Hispanic artists and artisans in the Southwest.
 In White Cod, the American modernist Marsden Hartley transformed the traditional allegorical function of still life as a memento mori, a reminder that all living things must die, into a deeply personal memorial. The two dead cod most likely allude to the 1936 drowning of Alton and Donald Mason, sons of a Nova Scotia fishing family with whom he lived during the summers of 1935 and 1936. Hartley linked the deaths of his beloved friends to Christ’s martyrdom through the traditional Christian symbolism of the fish. His expressive brushwork and somber palette also enhance the emotional intensity of this painting.
 The months that Hartley spent in Corea, Maine, in 1942 were exceptionally prolific because he was vigorously preparing for a one-person exhibition organized by his new dealer, Paul Rosenberg. Many of the paintings he executed were vibrant floral still lifes such as this one, most likely created with the expectation that they would be especially marketable.
 Here, Yasuo Kuniyoshi takes on a subject typical of his later career: still lifes. He named the pitcher depicted in this painting Juanita after purchasing it in Mexico on his honeymoon. Born in Japan, Kuniyoshi moved to California as a teenager. After studying in Los Angeles, he settled in New York. There, he was influenced by European modernist styles that his artist friends were exploring and by Japanese design and iconography, seen here in the monochromatic and flattened composition. Though labeled an “enemy alien” after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Kuniyoshi remained pro-American and even designed posters for the Office of War Information.
 Near the end of his life, after spending much of his career in New York, Marsden Hartley attempted to restyle himself as a painter from Maine. He used gulls, crabs, and lobsters in his work as icons of his New England roots. A poet as well as a painter, Hartley was inspired by the tenacity of the people and the ruggedness of the landscape. He belonged to the photographer Alfred Stieglitz’s circle of artists, who sought to create modern art that was spiritually rooted to the American soil.
 Vivid color and the lively interaction of abstracted forms convey a raucous mood in this small landscape. The work was created during a transitional period in Stuart Davis's art when he turned from a relatively restrained Cubist aesthetic to one more closely aligned with decorative impulses. The clay pipe, gas station, and barber pole reprise the principal elements of his 1932 mural for the Radio City Music Hall Men's Lounge at Rockefeller Center, originally entitled Men without Women. Here, however, the symbols of masculine activity register with a colorful vitality that fulfills Davis's aims for an art that was truly American in its outlook.
 Max Weber was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Bialystok, in modern Poland. In 1891 the Webers immigrated to Brooklyn, where Max studied art at the Pratt Institute. Between 1905 and 1908, he was in Paris, where he became one of the first Americans to fully absorb Cubism. The Visit is a Cubist domestic scene, probably depicting a courtship or a Shabbat (Sabbath) gathering—the men’s clothing and hats are typical of Jewish Orthodox dress. Weber began painting nostalgic scenes of Jewish domestic life in 1918, possibly in response to the pogroms that were then decimating entire Jewish populations in his native eastern Europe.
 Maya women in Guatemala wear traditional blouses, or huipil, as emblems of their ethnic and community identity. The multicolored geometric designs brocaded on the front, back, and shoulders of this huipil identify it as Quiche Maya from Chichicastenango. An abstract double-headed eagle motif appears on the front and back center panels as well as on the shoulders. Black silk appliqués decorate the sunburst design and four disks around the neck opening, representing the four cardinal directions.In agricultural societies such as the Maya, clothing designs relate to the natural world and have the power to protect the wearer from supernatural harm. When opened and laid flat, the huipil design has cosmological significance: the head opening becomes the sun, surrounded by the four directions and other designs inspired by the natural world. The wearer is therefore placed at the center of the universe.
 The Chemex coffeemaker was designed to be easy to grasp, like a chemistry beaker. The form of the human hand itself thus dictated its shape, at least insofar as the central hand-hold was concerned. The evocation of the “hourglass” female shape was probably incidental.
 Like the modernist John Marin before him, Milton Avery described landscapes in a spare and summary way, using a variety of precisely placed touches to suggest the key details of a place. In this view of the rolling coastline of Canada’s rugged Gaspé Peninsula, parallel charcoal lines and strokes of blue wash together indicate the trees on a hillside. Unlike Marin (whose work is also on view here), however, Avery always anchored his shorthand details within an overall composition, based in a few simple outlines and extending to the edges of the sheet.
 During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Japan exported large quantities of all types of objects, at a range of prices, to the West. Fashionable consumers purchased and displayed these objects in their homes. An item such as this fine album would have been prized not only for its exotic beauty but also for its sensitivity to the natural world, evident in the closely observed pictures of birds, insects, and plants.
 These sleek modernist versions of Pegasus, the flying horse of classical mythology, once flanked the entrances to the New York City Fire Service Pumping Station that still stands on Neptune Avenue between West Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Streets. The station boosted water pressure for fire fighting in outlying areas of Brooklyn. These four pairs of winged horses arise from stylized curving forms that suggest waves or clouds. Their compact double profiles reflect the Art Deco style of the industrial building whose entrances they once adorned. The streamlined design style was widely used in the 1920s and 1930s.

 A founding member of the Abstract Expressionist group known as the New York School, Richard Pousette-Dart began producing large, actively painted compositions of mystically symbolic shapes in the 1940s. Inspired by Native American, African, and Oceanic art, as well as the philosophy of Carl Jung, he strived toward a universal formal language through which to convey transcendent spiritual truths. His finest canvases are complexly constructed and have the effect of emitting light. The artist wrote in 1957, “A work of art for me is a window . . . or a doorway to every other human being. It is my contact and union with the universe.”
 To honor deceased family members, villagers kept carved wooden figures to contain the souls of their ancestors in the family house. These two female figures (adu bihara) holding small bowls are a type of image that was often tied together in a row to suggest a lineage of ancestors.

 Widely known by the 1930s as a muralist and political activist, Diego Rivera often undertook subjects rooted in indigenous Mexican traditions and folklore. This painting of bizarre tree forms set against a rocky hillside takes its name from the Spanish word for copal (nahuatl, in Aztec), the aromatic tree resin employed for centuries in Mesoamerica as incense. Copal was considered the “blood” of trees, and thereby suitable as food for the gods in the form of incense. The substance had artistic significance as well, as a binder for pigments employed in ancient mural painting.
 Figural realism was the dominant mode in American painting throughout the 1930s, when many artists strove to respond directly to the urgent, and often dire, social issues of the day. The Woodstock colony artist Alexander Brook was something of an exception in his preference for “studio pictures” of the sort that had been more current in the twenties, and in which a model’s physical presence was the primary subject. In Bacchante, the placement of the model’s hand enhances the masklike quality of the face and creates an arresting mood.
 Albert Swinden’s abstractions have been referred to as “calmly classical visions.” These words provide an apt description for this mural specifically, with its carefully balanced, disciplined composition of rectangular shapes punctuated by occasional biomorphic forms. Swinden seldom wrote about his art, but his brief essay “On Simplification,” published in the 1938 American Abstract Artists Yearbook, provides a succinct comment on the aesthetic concerns embodied in this mural. “We are moved not only by particular, or individual forms,” he wrote, “but by the relationships between the particular forms and their significance as a unity.”Swinden’s Williamsburg mural does not conform to his original conception for it. The changes he made (such as the addition of a black horizontal strip of canvas at the top and a wide, broken band of blue on the right) were probably in response to the demands of the specific space in which the mural was installed at the Williamsburg Housing Project. Similarly, the two inserts of unpainted canvas in the upper right and left corners represent areas occupied by structural beams at the mural’s original Williamsburg site. Swinden was born in Birmingham, England, and lived in Canada from the age of seven until his immigration to the United States in 1919. After studying at The Art Institute of Chicago for about eighteen months, he settled in New York City. There he enrolled in art classes at the National Academy of Design but soon decided to attend the Art Students League instead, where he studied from 1930 to 1934 and began to teach in 1932. He also studied for a time with the influential artist Hans Hofmann.Despite his association with, and position of respect among, some of the most progressive artists of his day, Swinden was unsuccessful in promoting his art in the commercial sphere. Although he was instrumental in founding the American Abstract Artists, was selected by Burgoyne Diller to execute important murals for the Williamsburg Housing Project and the 1939 World’s Fair, and was included in many group exhibitions in the 1940s, he often supported himself working as a textile designer or an engineering draftsman. Even though Swinden painted steadily throughout his life, his oeuvre is comparatively small. In addition, most of his early paintings were destroyed in 1940 in a fire at the studio he shared with Balcomb Greene (whose Williamsburg mural is also on view nearby). These facts increase the historical and aesthetic significance of Swinden’s “rediscovered” Williamsburg mural, for it now stands as a rare, and possibly the most important, surviving example of his early work.
 Paul Kelpe’s Williamsburg murals, like those of Bolotowsky, Greene, and Swinden, were conceived as entirely nonobjective compositions. However, they reveal a distinctly different approach to abstraction. Kelpe is unique among these artists for his strikingly unusual color combinations, his decorative patterning of selected fields of color, and his sculpturesque forms suggesting axial rotation.Kelpe was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists and participated actively in the organization as an exhibitor and an officeholder. Despite the stance of unity among the organization’s members in their desire to promote the acceptance of abstraction, Kelpe’s work provoked considerable criticism from within the group. His critics, most of whom favored the gridded geometries inspired by Mondrian, deplored his persistence in maintaining an illusionistic, three-dimensional space in which his abstract geometric solids float. Kelpe was thoroughly familiar with the European avant-garde. Born in Minden, Germany, he studied art history and architecture in Hanover, where he gained firsthand knowledge of the work of Kurt Schwitters, Wassily Kandinsky, and the Russian Constructivists, among others. After immigrating to the United States in 1925, he settled in Chicago in 1931. When he applied to the Chicago Regional Mural Division of the Federal Art Project, his application was denied because his bold abstract imagery did not correspond with the realistically rendered portrayals of American life that the Chicago office preferred. This rejection spurred him to move to New York City, where his abstractions found a more favorable response from Burgoyne Diller, who hired him to participate in the New York City Works Progress Administration Mural Program at Williamsburg.Although Kelpe continued to paint and exhibit frequently, he also pursued more academic aspects of art and earned a master’s degree and a doctorate in art history from the University of Chicago in 1948 and 1957, respectively. After teaching art history at the university level for many years, he retired in 1969 to devote himself to painting.
 The cool austerity revealed in Balcomb Greene’s mural displayed here provides a visual equivalent to the intellectual concerns he articulated in many essays and lectures throughout his career. Born in Milville, New York, and raised in the Midwest, Greene earned a B.A. in philosophy from Syracuse University in 1926. His introduction to the art world was through the young artist Gertrude Glass, whom he met in 1926 and married shortly thereafter. Greene went on for graduate study in psychology in Vienna in 1927. On returning to the United States, he shifted his focus to English literature, studying at Columbia University and then teaching at Dartmouth College from 1928 to 1931. Thereafter, the Greenes went to Paris, where Gertrude pursued her own career and Balcomb continued to write—poetry and fiction—and also became more deeply engaged with contemporary art. In Paris both Balcomb and Gertrude Greene found aesthetic affinity with the ideas of the Abstraction-Creation group, which emphasized pure plastic (or formal) elements such as line, color, and shape, and rejected anecdotal or natural elements and identifiablesubject matter.Greene’s relatively sudden embrace of painting met with early success, and he had his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1931. The Greenes returned to New York in 1932. Although Balcomb continued to write, his attention was increasingly drawn to painting. As a founder and the first chairman of the American Abstract Artists, Greene was an important force in promoting the group’s beliefs both in his paintings and in print.In the late 1930s Greene worked for the Mural Division of the WPA/FAP, executing this Williamsburg mural and another important one for the Federal Hall of Medicine at the 1939 World’s Fair. He also earned a master’s degree in art history at New York University in 1941.From 1942 to 1959 Greene taught art history and aesthetics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. Although he continued to paint and exhibit actively, he was no longer affiliated with any particular artists’ group or communal aesthetic or sociopolitical efforts. His work of the 1930s underscored his belief that art should be impersonal—as shown here in the cool remoteness of this mural—yet he turned in the early 1940s to an abstract idiom that relied on identifiable objects, a manner that he explored in his late paintings created in the Long Island studio that became his base in 1959.
 Of the four artists represented here, Ilya Bolotowsky achieved the greatest and most sustained measure of recognition. An intellectually and physically energetic man, he had wideranging interests that encompassed writing short stories and plays, collecting Eskimo and other North American Indian art, and making his own documentary and experimental films. Bolotowsky was primarily a painter, however, and was among the first of his generation to paint abstractions.Bolotowsky was born in Petrograd, Russia, to staunchly anti-Communist parents who later fled the country for political reasons. After some years in Constantinople, where he attended St. Joseph’s College from 1921 to 1923, his family finally settled in New York in 1923. From 1924 to 1930 Bolotowsky studied at the National Academy of Design, where he was trained to work in a figurative manner. In 1933, however, he saw paintings by Piet Mondrian and Joan Miró and was moved by their example to experiment in an entirely nonfigurative mode. As demonstrated in his Williamsburg mural displayed here, he had, by 1936, fully embraced an idiom that testifies to his admiration for Miró in both its lively interaction of hard-edged geometric and biomorphic shapes and its use of bright, unmodeled areas of color. The issue of pictorial space versus flatness was central to discussions among the members of the American Abstract Artists, in which Bolotowsky figured prominently. This mural may be seen to incorporate the two opposing approaches; some of his shapes seem to cavort in a vaguely illusionistic space, while others appear to be solidly anchored on the painting’s surface, emphasizing the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.By the 1940s Bolotowsky had devoted himself to the strict Neoplasticism of Mondrian. He continued to create his own variations on geometric abstraction for the rest of his career.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 With the introduction of the famous Fereghan horses from Central Asia, the course of Chinese history shifted significantly. Warfare, pageantry, and trade were affected by this development, as was Chinese art.The realistic modeling of these two sixth-century horses represents a long tradition of the equine form in funerary sculpture. The dynamic movement portrayed by the figure's turned torso is a new element of the era. Saddles became important decorative objects themselves in later periods.
 In this painting on paper, biomorphic shapes spread across the picture, changing form and moving in space. As with the Surrealists who practiced automatism, Gorky’s imagery revealed itself only in the process of creation, as pictorial ideas gradually emerged from the subconscious depths of the mind.Yet on another level, it is interesting to note that Gorky volunteered to serve in the camouflage section of the U.S. Army (though he was rejected on grounds of age). And he organized a class in camouflage painting, at the Grand Central School of Art in New York, because, as he wrote, such work would help the artist “deepen and enrich his understanding of art as well as make him an important contributor to civilian and military defense.” Beyond the self-absorbed practices of the Surrealists, therefore, he felt that art could also play a role in the war effort.This particular work has been compared to Picasso’s Guernica, painted a few years earlier, which Gorky is known to have admired. Both are intensely personal responses to the violence of war.
 With music playing at night and rooftop dancing, Childs Restaurant was one of many establishments at Coney that offered moderately priced food for people of average means. It opened on the boardwalk in 1923 at the time that many establishments had to move from Surf Avenue so that the main street and the Bowery could be widened to facilitate fire-extinguishing efforts. Clad in polychrome terracotta and inventively decorated with maritime themes, the shell of Childs Restaurant remains on the boardwalk today. It was designated a New York City landmark in 2003.
 Variations of the Tunnels of Love were among the early rides in the amusement parks at Coney. Like many other rides, they encouraged informal contact between men and women and provided new opportunities for interaction between young people. When these rides were introduced at the turn of the twentieth century, social etiquette often still made relaxed communication difficult.
 The 1920s was a prosperous period for Coney Island. This is a view of the boardwalk looking east from one of the new landmarks of this time: the large Half Moon Hotel with magnificent ocean views. Visitors to the boardwalk could rent wicker rolling chairs for a leisurely ride along the beach. In the 1940s, the hotel was turned into a maternity hospital.
 A boli is an abstract figure kept in a shrine belonging to a secret Bamana men's association. It is believed to be the embodiment of the spiritual powers of the society. These powers underlie the ability of the association to maintain social control. Today, the Kono society has lost its influence in most Bamana communities due to the conversion of Bamana to Islam.The basic form of this boli resembles a highly simplified cow. It is composed of a wooden core over-modeled with materials such as mud, eggs, chewed kola nuts, sacrificial blood, urine, honey, beer, vegetable fiber, and cow dung. The use of blood, excrement, and urine reflects the belief that these organic substances possess extremely potent spiritual powers.
 
 This informal portrait of Muzaffar al-Din Shah (r. 1896–1907) has been attributed to ‘Abdallah Qajar, who served as a court photographer to Nasir al-Din Shah. He later headed the photography department at the Dar al-funun, a European-inspired institution of higher learning where artists learned how to produce portraits in various media and traditions. ‘Abdallah Qajar also owned a commercial studio next to the Dar al-funun, which suggests that there was a market for photography outside of the court. The artist’s repertoire consists mostly of landscapes and portraits of high-ranking officials and royal family members. Here, Muzaffar al-Din Shah’s informal attire is emphasized by a couple of unbuttoned buttons on his overcoat.
Becoming AnotherThe play associated with masquerade can lead to the invention of new types of identities and new hybrid, not-quite-human masked beings. Moments of passage—into or out of this world, through birth or death, or from childhood to adulthood—bring with them the potential for disorder. Masquerade can offer a vision of transcendence, suggesting that such concerns belong to a world beyond limited human understanding. By transforming its participants into nonhuman beings, masquerade performance transcends everyday human reality and reminds all involved that their immediate concerns are governed by forces larger than themselves.Both of these masks by Mossi artists portray a being that combines human and animal characteristics. The tall, plank-like mask suggests a human-antelope hybrid, while the horizontal mask has both antelope and birdlike features.Most Mossi masks symbolically depict totemic animals associated with particular clans. Each family has an animal with which it has mythological connections and which protects it from harm. Such masks would appear at the funerals of important family members, a moment loaded with personal, community, and spiritual significance. At the end of their own active lives, masks might go on to second lives as altars, providing connection to the spirits of commemorated ancestors.
 The Dancer brooch and earrings were inspired by a photograph by Barbara Morgan of the dancer Martha Graham performing in Letters to the World in 1941. A free-flowing silhouette, the brooch was cut from a sheet of silver. Wiener said of this piece, “Even in doing literal translations, it was important to move into abstraction and evolve a secondary level of recognition.”

 Attributing a specific piece of ritual African art to a particular artist is seldom possible, in part because the artists often perpetuated the myth that the objects were not the work of human beings, and also because the original collectors of these pieces rarely inquired about the artists' names. This piece, however, has been attributed to Areogun of Osi, one of the most prominent Yoruba artists of the twentieth century. His distinctive style is identifiable in the figure's elaborate openwork headdress, proportionally large ears, and curved breasts.Kneeling female figures, often nude, are common in Yoruba religious art. In this pose, the figure represents a supplicant before the orisha, or deity, on whose altar it is placed. The image beautifies the altar and thereby honors orisha.
 Norman Rockwell’s naturalistic style, charming characterizations, and easily legible narratives of small-town life made him America’s most beloved illustrator. While his images are generally perceived as straightforward reflections of American life, they frequently demonstrate greater complexity. The Tattoo Artist, for example, subtly alludes to contemporary aesthetics—in particular, modernism’s interest in decorative patterns and the flatness of the picture plane—by suspending the figures in front of a wallpaper-like background of tattoo designs.
 Becoming AgainMasquerade is a moment for play—a chance to invent and experiment, even within established social needs and existing mask genres. These two pairs of related works demonstrate artistic innovation in existing masquerade genres over time.The two Bobo works share a basic form—a domed helmet with an extended vertical face, close-set eyes, and ridged horns—typical of Bobo mask style. The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.The Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living. The bright paint and overexaggerated features of the late twentieth-century version demonstrate how Senufo artists have updated this mask form over time.
 Body Language The bold, open pose of the woman in Evening indicates that she is actively encouraging her partner’s attention. In contrast, the confidence man, or con man, in the adjacent painting stands aggressively near his female companion. His almost threatening stance and her downcast face suggest that he is not to be trusted. Despite the physical closeness of these two sets of figures, their faces are inscrutable and the nature of their interactions remains ambiguous. Guy Pène du Bois frequently painted stiff figures with masklike faces, suggesting social alienation beneath the glitter and gloss of the party scene.
 This watercolor image is called a Kalighat painting, produced quickly and in multiples for sale in the markets around the Kali temple in Kolkata at the turn of the twentieth century. Common features of Kalighat paintings are the loose application of shading around the arms, legs, and faces of the figures and the rudimentary curtain at the top to suggest a stage or altar setting. Indian modernist artists of the early twentieth century would cite Kalighat paintings as a source of inspiration, noting that their Indian predecessors were abstracting the human form even before European painters.
 Boris Grigoriev trained in art academies in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Paris before finding inspiration in Russian cabarets on the eve of the October Revolution. He immigrated permanently to France in 1921 and continued producing his psychological portraits of Russian showgirls, artists, monks, and peasants. In Old Trombola Grigoriev heightens his sitter’s emotional state by emphasizing his intense gaze and exaggerating the sculptural qualities of his weathered hands and face. Grigoriev later wrote, “I have been watching and studying the Russian people for many years ... and these paintings are the fruits of my observations.”
 The Spacelander is a marvel of postwar biomorphic design. Its curving lines and amoeba-like voids represent the mutation of the prewar streamlined style into a new expression based on organic, rather than machine-made, forms. Although the prototype—made for a 1946 exhibition of British industrial design—was a critical success, Benjamin Bowden failed in his attempts to have it manufactured. By the time it finally went into production in the United States in 1960, tastes had changed and the price of the bicycle—$89.50—was too high. It is believed that only about five hundred examples were ever sold, making it one of the rarest and most sought-after industrial designs of the mid-twentieth century. When new, this bicycle was bright red; the color has faded over time.
 The Ball wall clock, sometimes called the Atomic clock, has become an icon of mid-twentieth century American design. It was the star of a line commissioned by the Howard Miller Clock Company to update its collection for a new, postwar generation of consumers. The rods and spheres evoking the structure of the atom introduced a modern scientific note into home or office interiors.
 The DCM is one of the most important and influential chairs of the postwar period. Although its official name mundanely refers to its use and materials—dining chair, metal (base)—it is commonly known as the “Potato Chip” chair because of its crisp, curving shapes. Growing out of wartime efforts to create a splint that conformed to the contours of the leg, this chair too is “organic” because its function is to support, and mimic, the shape of the human body.
 Kees van Dongen made a splash in 1920s Paris chronicling the city’s high society. His winning formula, exemplified here, involved placing his sitters against a neutral backdrop and punctuating the composition with brilliant—even supernatural—color. For his portrait of W. S. Davenport, an American dentist living in Paris, van Dongen added blue-green highlights to the face and a bright red brushstroke to the lapel. That red accent depicts a red thread that indicates Davenport’s knighthood in the exclusive Legion of Honor, awarded for his pioneering of facial reconstruction surgery during World War I.
 Clarence Carter’s “portrait” of the Sommer Brothers Hardware Store in Portsmouth, Ohio, is a quaint example of the rise of American Scene painting in the 1920s. Artists associated with this trend focused on images of rural or small-town locales and often described them in a deliberately simplified form of realism related to American folk art, then rising in popularity. Carter here commemorated a thriving commercial block—well-known throughout southern Ohio—that would be damaged beyond salvage in the 1937 Ohio River flood.
 Hospitality is an important virtue in many African societies. Among the Dan, the woman with the greatest reputation for hospitality is known as a wunkerle. On public occasions, she carries a spoon known as a wunkermian as a staff of office.
 This prototype of a vessel for pouring baby oil exemplifies both the wit and the practicality of Eva Zeisel’s designs. What does it feel like and how does it work are two questions always on her mind. In this case, though simplified and abstract, the shape wittily evokes a rabbit. The body of the vessel is meant to be held in one hand (with the baby cradled in the other) while the hand squeezes the “ears” to open the spout at the mouth and pour. The object not only feels pleasant in the hand but also performs its function well.
 In the period between the world wars, American manufacturers often hired freelance industrial designers to enhance the images of their products. Electrolux hired Lurelle Guild to redesign their vacuum cleaner. He produced an iconic design that embodies the era's fascination with speed and efficiency and incorporated new materials such as rubber and chrome to make Electrolux appear more innovative. This design, with variations such as the substitution of wheels for the gliders, remained in production for over twenty years.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

 Figurative posts often support the verandas of distinguished places such as important shrines or the dwellings of kings, titled elders, and priests. Just as a post supports the house, the carved figures represent the individuals who support and uphold the leader in his office.

 An nkisi nkondi serves as a container for potent ingredients used in magic and medicine, and in judicial and healing contexts. To make an nkisi nkondi, a carver begins by sculpting a human or animal figure with a cavity in the abdomen; then a ritual expert completes the work by placing ingredients with supernatural powers on the object and in the cavity provided. He activates the figure by breathing into the cavity and immediately seals it off with a mirror. Nails and blades are driven into the figure, either to affirm an oath or to destroy an evil force. The figure’s pose suggests that it may once have been carrying a knife or spear.
 The vegetable-shaped salt and pepper shakers and the curvilinear flask are splendid examples of the Aesthetic Movement style, which appeared strikingly new and modern to consumers at the time. The form of the shakers was inspired by realistic Japanese metal objects with which Americans were just becoming familiar, and their maker used a newly invented process to patinate the silver to resemble weathered copper. The irregular, ergonomic contour and dense Southwestern landscape of the flask would have also seemed quite daring to the original purchaser. In contrast, the all-over, hard-edged design of the later flask evokes the emerging, dynamic skyscraper skyline of big cities, and the unadorned, pyramidal forms of the later salt and pepper shakers have a timeless quality. While all of these objects were progressive when made, only the later ones still speak the language of modern design.
 ART OF VIRTUEArt can express our most important values. For the youngest of students to the most senior of elders, art can provide a vision of the ideal world. This writing board is evidence and expression of devotion and discipline, and a connection to an international community connected by Arabic, the language of the Qur'an. In Sudan, students historically used wood writing boards to practice their Arabic calligraphy and to help them memorize Qur'anic verses. The text written on the front of this board is a verse from the Qur'an, sura 97, which addresses the night of the first revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammad. The Lega figure called sakimatwemtwe, or "the man with many heads," represents the qualities of equity, wisdom, and discernment that enable its owner to see all sides of an issue and have knowledge of all things going on around him. It would have been owned by a man who belonged to Kindi, the highest level of Bwami, a hierarchical organization through which Lega initiates advance from one state of knowledge to the next.
 This striking mask, with its grimacing mouth, bean-shaped eyes, and bulbous, hooked nose, was made in the northern part of New Caledonia. The thick, shiny patina is evidence of the piece's age and considerable use. The holes around the perimeter were used to affix the beard and wig of human hair, a hat, feathers, and other elements of the costume that completely draped to the knees the dancer who wore it. Little is known about the function of these masks, however, though it is usually said that they represent the spirits of ancestors returning to the village. They may have been associated with now-extinct secret men's associations or used in social control.
 The career of Bob Thompson, the noted African American artist, was cut short by his early death at the age of twenty-eight. Thompson was born near Louisville, Kentucky, and studied at the University of Louisville and at Boston University. In the early and mid-1960s, he traveled throughout Europe and experienced many Renaissance paintings and other artworks firsthand. He fused the vigor and vibrancy of Expressionism with themes from Old Master compositions and the vivid palette of Fauve painting to create the original visual vocabulary exemplified by The Judgment. Recalling such time-honored Old Master subjects as the Last Judgment and the Judgment of Paris, here a nude male trio sits before faceless winged female angels while two figures (at left) await judgment. The planar, flattened figures and compositional contours in a gesturally applied background are all equally emphasized.
 When Lois Mailou Jones painted Leigh Whipper, the latter was at the height of his career as a Broadway and Hollywood actor. Within months of sitting for this portrait, Whipper would be famous for his role as Crooks in the 1939 movie adaptation of John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. Whipper’s character—a handicapped stable hand ostracized because of his race—served to illuminate the movie’s Depressionera message that the American Dream’s promise of economic and social success was impossible.This portrait shows Whipper as if seated at a Paris café. Jones herself had recently returned from a sabbatical in France and was teaching at Howard University in Washington, D.C. There she came under the influence of the Harlem Renaissance intellectual Alain Locke. Her portrayal of a pensive Whipper answered Locke’s call for black artists to create ennobling portrayals of African Americans.
 Necklaces like this one were made by the Ainu people, who inhabited parts of Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands before those areas were claimed by Japanese and Russian settlers. Ainu women wore these necklaces on formal occasions, and the necklaces were also displayed inside houses, alongside other treasured items. The origin of the glass beads may have contributed to the value of these items, as they were often imported from the southern islands of Japan or other foreign sources, traveling through extensive trade routes that linked the Ainu to distant communities in Manchuria and Sakhalin, among others.
 Gilbert Rohde ran one of the most successful American design studios of the early twentieth century. In a series of clocks designed for Herman Miller Clock Company, he transformed the traditional timepiece into a contemporary idiom through stark geometry, sleek curves, and modern numerals. This clock was first exhibited at the 1933-34 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago.
 Based on a life study of a seated male bather swathed in a towel and reading a newspaper, Villon’s simultaneously geometric and organic painting blends hard- and softedged intersecting planes with the contours of a powerful, muscular body and its enveloping white drapery. Although this work developed out of an initial interest in the human form, the artist gave it a title that evokes the metaphysical realm of the intellect or the incorporeal—reflecting Villon’s own considered approach to painting.
 Josef Albers’s Homage to the Square series is a study of the illusionistic effects of color. Starting with the rigorous geometry of nested squares, Albers created these works by applying paint directly from the tube and spreading it onto the Masonite board with a palette knife. The juxtaposed slabs of color play off one another, as some squares seem to recede into space while others float into the foreground. Albers pursued this study of color and perception from 1950 until his death, producing nearly a thousand canvases in the series.
 Augustus Aaron Wilson, a retired lighthouse keeper, is best known for his duck decoys and other small carvings. When the Ringling Brothers circus came to town in 1931, he was inspired by Emyr, said to be the largest tiger in captivity, to carve these tigers from salvaged railroad ties and telephone poles that he kept in his barn. The smaller of these two works is thought to be the earlier attempt.

 Throughout his career, Gifford Reynolds Beal painted subjects that celebrated American leisure pursuits in the decades between the two World Wars. In keeping with the extraordinary popularity of public rodeos during the Depression era, here the artist took on the theme of rodeo roughriders. The dynamism of the scene, in which two men help a third off a bucking horse, is enhanced by Beal’s brushy application of paint and use of bold lines.
 One of the first nationally recognized African American artists, Jacob Lawrence came to maturity in Harlem in the 1930s—a dynamic milieu marked by the great cultural achievements of the Harlem Renaissance, yet also by racism and the Great Depression. Throughout his long career, Lawrence devoted himself to painting genre scenes of working-class black life and epic series about African American history. Displaying the abstracted design elements and vibrant colors that characterize Lawrence’s style, Funeral Sermon commemorates the death of his sister from tuberculosis in 1944. An expression of personal grief, this work also addresses larger social issues, including the importance of spirituality in the black community—notice how Lawrence unifies the congregation in the foreground through the repetition of geometric forms—and the overcrowded housing and inadequate health-care facilities in Harlem that led to disease and untimely death.
 This portrait bust of President Abraham Lincoln was derived from the full-length standing portrait completed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1887 for Chicago’s Lincoln Park. Saint-Gaudens based Lincoln’s likeness on plaster life casts of the president’s head. The sculptor was inspired by Lincoln’s landmark 1860 speech at Cooper Union in New York, in which the future president declared that the founders would have opposed the expansion of slavery into new American territories. In this speech Lincoln also made famous the phrase “Let us have faith that right makes might.”
 The ikupasuy is a sacred object used for prayer. The worshipper dips the sharper end into rice wine (sake) or millet beer, and then sprinkles drops of the liquor. The ikupasuy is believed to be a medium for sending a message to a spirit or god. Delicately carved in relief on plain wood, ikupasuy show numerous design variations. They were sometimes lacquered by neighboring Japanese.
 Although best known as a portraitist, the Brooklyn painter Benjamin Osro Eggleston also enjoyed sketching the interesting characters he encountered around the city—an activity that harks back to his early career as a newspaper illustrator. This assured drawing captures the forceful personality of an anonymous girl whose anxious yet determined expression suggests she is steeling herself for a confrontation, perhaps with other children trying to take her apple.
 Charles Sheeler saw the modern equivalent of the imposing religious architecture of the past in the expansive, streamlined masses of factory buildings and refineries. Incantation, whose very title sounds like a spiritual evocation, is a fragmentary view of a continuous-flow oil production plant. Here Sheeler reduced the architectural forms to a more two-dimensional design in which shadows play as weighty a role as the metal tanks and pipes. The lack of a human presence suggests the degree to which these vast plants had come to be viewed as nearly autonomous forces.
 Josef Albers had a lifelong interest in color’s meditative qualities. With the help of simple color combinations, he aimed to show that flat shapes on a two-dimensional surface can create an illusion of movement and depth. Albers believed that the introduction of a white line into one of the color fields affected the perception of the color on both sides of the line. He felt that experimentation with subtle colors—as in these two works—proved the power of the line and the efficacy of his theory.
 These large keystones of male heads wearing garlands of grapevines represent satyrs (mythological creatures that are part human and part animal) or, perhaps, Bacchus, the god of wine in classical mythology. Their lively visages once adorned the facade of the Park Lane Hotel at Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Streets in Manhattan. The fourteen-story building was demolished in 1966.

 In this dynamic work, part of Willem de Kooning’s Woman series, the image is neither fully abstract nor completely representational. Human body parts, though discernible, are obscured by rich and frenzied painterly lines. Facial features are the artist’s only concession to an identifiable figure. The masklike face, flattened forms, and almond-shaped eyes show the influence of Pablo Picasso, whose work fascinated de Kooning from an early age. Born in the Netherlands, de Kooning came to the United States in 1926 in pursuit of the American dream as a stowaway aboard a British freighter.
 “Letting people have your paintings is like letting them wear your clothes,” said Florine Stettheimer, who was intensely private about her art. Her typically quirky mix of fantasy and reality is present in Heat—a family portrait of her mother, herself, and her three sisters gathered to celebrate Mrs. Stettheimer’s birthday.
 For some, modernity resulted in an increasing feeling of alienation, as people began moving through spaces at a faster pace. Edward Hopper captured this transitory nature of modern life in paintings infused with a sense of isolation and estrangement. Completed at the height of Hopper’s career, this painting shows Macombs Dam Bridge, which connects Manhattan and the Bronx. There are no signs of life in the city. Instead, an eerie stillness pervades the scene, resulting in a disquieting mood.
 An American architect, teacher, and writer, William Spratling helped to revive the moribund silver trade in Taxco in the 1930s after the town’s mines closed in the preceding decade in the wake of the Mexican Revolution. Spratling’s designs for silver frequently melded modern design forms with pre-Columbian motifs from Aztec, Mayan, and Olmec sources.
 One of Germany’s leading Symbolists, Stuck frequently painted biblical or mythological subjects that addressed dark themes such as sin and death. Particularly interested in the narrative and details of the Crucifixion, Stuck devoted several canvases to this subject late in his career, during the difficult years of World War I. Calling on new scholarly theories regarding the Gospel accounts, Stuck departs from tradition and places Christ at eye level with the witnesses to his sufferings. The artist cleverly structures his composition, placing the viewer immediately to the left of the crucified thief in the foreground and to the right of the haloed Virgin Mary, thereby closing a solemn yet intimate circle. Stuck also chooses to show Christ with his feet side by side rather than overlapping—again, referencing nineteenth-century debates about the historical details of this method of execution.
 Active as an artist, writer, and critic, Louis Lozowick is best known for stunning lithographs, such as this one, depicting urban and industrial scenes in the crisp geometric style of Precisionism. When he immigrated to the United States as a teenager, he encountered the iconography of the modern Machine Age—skyscrapers, factories, bridges, railroads—that would fascinate him for the remainder of his career. In Tanks (No. 1), Lozowick creates a celebratory vision of a nocturnal industrial landscape with a monumental storage tank rising heroically through a lattice of pipes and scaffolding. The image also speaks to progress through the juxtaposition of an airplane and a team of horses. Mastery of the lithographic medium is evident in the velvety surfaces and subtle tonal gradations, while the simplification of forms and faceted planes reveal Lozowick's debt to Cubism, Russian Constructivism, and other avant-garde styles that he saw during his travels in Europe in the 1920s.
 Faith Ringgold completed this work at the beginning of her artistic career, prior to the development of her signature painted “story-quilts.” However, its stylized figuration, strong colors, and bold black outlines would come to characterize much of her later work. Here Ringgold portrays herself with a determined gaze and folded arms, in a gesture simultaneously gentle and guarded. The work makes reference to Pop art and the work of Pablo Picasso, as well as the political ferment of the early 1960s. In reflecting on this work and the political and artistic awakening she experienced during this period, Ringgold has said, “I was trying to find my voice, talking to myself through my art.”
 In Manhattan Mosaic, George Copeland Ault’s narrow view of urban rooftops transforms the buildings into an abstract mosaic of planes and angles. The play of overlapping shapes, the harmonious blend of brown tonalities, and the deep shadows created by strong light emphasize the rich visual geometries of the modern city. At the same time, the composition’s tightly enclosed rooftop space reveals only a small view of the sky in the distance, suggesting a feeling of claustrophobia and anxiety that some associated with urban life.
 Is this a painting, a sculpture, or both? Gertrude Greene is credited with having been the first American artist to create completely abstract wood reliefs such as this one. She was a founder (in 1936) of American Abstract Artists, an organization that promoted the work of American artists who felt that their art was overshadowed by their more famous European contemporaries.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 It is rare for decorative arts objects to evoke an artistic movement, but this armchair, formerly owned by J. J. P. Oud (Dutch, 1890–1963), another De Stijl architect, has become an icon of the style; it expresses De Stijl ideology through balanced application of color and the arrangement of geometric elements. De Stijl artists shunned historicism and naturalism and sought new, abstract forms to express the ideals of the future.
 The New York artist Leon Polk Smith grew up in Indian Territory, Oklahoma, with parents of partial Cherokee ancestry. He acknowledged that the bold colors and sense of movement in his work were probably influenced by Native American art. Here, red and black curves create an illusion of movement. The rounded canvas, or tondo, exhibits two near-colliding red disks, which seem to have moved across a black void and come to rest with their circumferences practically touching. Or is it the black void that has thrust itself between two stationary disks?
 A figure painter known from the 1930s on for his baldly satirical commentaries on human appetites and desires, Paul Cadmus was throughout a master draftsman. Although he undertook still-life subjects only rarely and, as he once stated, as “practice works like scales,” he achieved parity between figure and still life in Mobile. Here, a beautifully proportioned young man holds a mobile composed of beach detritus (wood, feathers, shells, and bones) in a delicate state of balance—a reference to the weightlessness of spent forms, and a meditation on mortality.
Morgan Russell temporarily abandoned his color abstractions--which he called Synchromies--to paint representational subjects with greater market appeal. In 1922, however, he returned to the Synchromistic aesthetic, which he found emotionally and creatively invigorating. Abstraction bears a strong formal relation to a series of paintings he called Eidos, a term taken from the Greek word meaning "form."  The illusion of spinning motion relates to Russell's plan to accompany his paintings with a kinetic light machine that would suggest the afterimage of fireworks. The signature along the horizontal is not in Russell's hand, and it is generally agreed that the painting should be oriented vertically.
 Even when inspired by a particular individual, representations of the human body can acquire universal meanings. Here, Standing Woman suggests an essential female force and vitality. Beginning in 1912, Gaston Lachaise began modeling standing figures inspired by his voluptuous American lover (and wife by 1917), Isabel Nagle.Indicative of its greater significance, Lachaise referred to his subject, in all its permutations, simply as “Woman.” Owing to its celebration of female physical abundance, critics attributed to this work and others like it a timelessness and a kinship with prehistoric representations of fertility.

 This cast aluminum ventilation cover is one of several from the main lobby of the Loew’s Grand Theater in Atlanta. After purchasing the building (originally built in 1893 as DeGive’s Grand Opera House) in the early 1930s, the Loew’s theater chain renovated the theater in the most up-to-date fashion according to designs by architect Thomas W. Lamb, one of the leading designers of American movie palaces. In 1939 the theater gained national renown as the site of the premiere of the film Gone with the Wind. When the building burned in 1978, architectural elements such as this were salvaged and sold. The donor purchased this grille on the demolition site.
 This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.

 In 1920 the subway was extended to Coney Island, making the trip even faster and cheaper than before. Up to one million visitors a day would come to enjoy the beaches and the amusement parks with higher and faster rides. The subway, like many of the rides in the amusement parks and the famous hot dogs at Nathan’s, cost five cents, a fact that contributed to the description of Coney as the Nickel Empire.
 The Coney Island beach was made public in 1915 after a long legal battle, and the boardwalk was finally constructed in 1923. Municipal baths replaced the private establishments, and the city added sand to fight erosion and create more beachfront. At this point the exclusive Seagate had long since separated from the main part of Coney, while the eastern end had gone out of fashion, with the last remaining resorts quickly disappearing. The Oriental Hotel closed in 1916, and Brighton Beach Hotel was razed a few years later. In the 1920s, many Eastern European Jews and Italian and Greek immigrants took up residence in the neighborhood adjoining the amusement district. Dreamland was long gone, and Luna somewhat declining, but Steeplechase was still a popular destination. In the background of this image, note the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel, the colorful Wonder Wheel from 1920 with its double ring of cars.
 Skyscrapers loom above older buildings, planes fly overhead, and people crowd the sidewalks in this dramatic bird’seye view of Manhattan’s Wall Street. Bertram Hartman’s meaning may not be quite so straightforward, however. He painted Trinity Church and Wall Street in the year of a great stock market crash that devastated the nation’s economy. By showing the gothic spires of Trinity Church overshadowed by skyscrapers, Hartman may have intended his viewers to contemplate the relationship between spiritual and material needs in modern life.
 The leading American modernist Arthur B. Davies had been exploring the theme of expressive modern dance in his paintings for about a decade when he completed this work. He addressed the effects of World War I, at least symbolically, with its title, which references the mounting casualties of the war. Inspired in part by the seminal modern dancer Isadora Duncan, Davies had often composed figure compositions suggestive of sequential movement and, therefore, of elapsed time and music. Here, the more rigid dramatic postures of the figures may have been modeled on the theatrical modern choreography of Ruth St. Denis.
 While Western collectors value the visual impact of power figures, the ultimate importance of these sculptures to the Songye lies in their effectiveness as protectors of the community from malevolent forces and disease. The power of such figures depends on their ingredients (bishimba), concealed in the abdominal cavity, in the top of the head, or in a horn set into the cranium (missing from this piece). These hidden substances acquire potency and interact with the spirit world when assembled by the nganga, or ritual practitioner.
 From 1920 to 1933, Prohibition, the United States government's vain attempt to ban alcoholic manufacturing and consumption, forced American to drink at home. This restriction led to a new social event, the cocktail party, and is accessories, the cocktail table and the cocktail shaker. This sleek cocktail set was made of a then-new material, chrome-plated metal, and the modern American icon, the skyscraper, inspired its design.

 With its combination of naturalistically painted flowers and Asian objects, this stunning watercolor recalls the still lifes of John La Farge, and demonstrates Western artists’ enduring fascination with art of the Far East into the twentieth century. Like La Farge, who was one of the earliest and most influential proponents of Japonisme in America, Anna Fisher sets up engaging contrasts between natural and artificial, ephemeral and enduring, and local and exotic.
 Korwar figures serve to keep surviving relatives in contact with their deceased ancestors and thus always able to secure their powerful blessings. They serve as a medium of communication between the living and the dead. Korwars may be standing or squatting figures. The heads are large in relation to the highly abstract bodies; the chin is usually straight, horizontal, and broad; and the nose is the most prominent facial feature. This highly unusual double figure holds a shield (now partially eroded). The shield has been said to derive from the snake, which in turn represents rejuvenation and regeneration, a key idea in the religion of the people of Cenderawasih Bay.
 Becoming ControlledBecause masks take on nonhuman, otherworldly characteristics, they are particularly effective as mediators of power. Despite their capacity for freedom and play, masks can also express social limits, serving as agents of calm in moments of tension or anxiety, or as frightening policers of the community on behalf of those in power.The Igbudu mask represents the evil forces that can threaten a community. One of the only examples of Yoruba sculptural art that is deliberately unattractive, it features a sharp brow, protruding eyes, and wide mouth—all designed to frighten.The commanding Loma mask, Okobuzogui, is used by the Poro society, a secret men’s association that serves, among other roles, to initiate boys into adulthood. Poro mythology holds that Okobuzogui “swallows” the boys in his menacing jaws as they leave the village for the initiation camp; he also accompanies them upon their return as young men.Tugunga headdresses are worn only by those who belong to a secret Bamum society of warriors, known as the Nsoro, who perform at the funerals of important members of the community. The masks impress with their size and grandeur and elicit fear and apprehension since they represent the society charged with adjudicating disputes and protecting the king.
 Already committed to a realistic style and to African American subjects, Eldzier Cortor was on his way to the Georgia Sea Islands when he was inspired to paint this image. A languid young couple is shown picnicking before the backdrop of a valley that has been flooded to construct a hydroelectric dam. Cortor endowed the muscular figures with a calm stoicism, modeling their facial features on the fixed and powerful forms of African masks. According to the artist, “[It] was created from my feelings in the face of devastation, and the two figures represent youth with hope.”
 This composition of dynamic forms is one of twelve works that George Lovett Kingsland Morris invested with references to Native American culture in an effort to create a distinctly American mode of abstraction, Morris was won over to abstraction during his stay in Paris from 1929 to 1930, when he studied with the avant-garde French artists Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant at the Académie de l'Art Moderne. Although Morris soon was among the most vigorous promoters of European-inspired abstract art in the United States, he encouraged artists to establish an original American vocabulary of forms by turning to indigenous arts for inspiration. Here the Native American references include the allusion to the texture of birch bark, the arcing, arrowlike form at the left, and the tooth- or clawlike forms in the lower register.
 Drawing played an integral preparatory role in the modernist sculpture of Chaim Gross, who used it to capture the poses of live models and to conceptualize his ideas for a work. This sheet served as a study for Ballerina (see illustration), featuring one of his favorite subjects—a female dancer or other performer. The drawing’s energetic hatch marks and looping scribbles anticipate the rough-hewn surface textures of the carved sculpture.
 The neighborhood around Wall Street has been the commercial center of New York City since colonial times. Before moving inside, brokers gathered outdoors to trade goods and stocks at various markets. The American Stock Exchange, one of many exchange places in the area, moved to an indoor space only in 1921. Until then, as Joseph Petrocelli captured in this iconic image, brokers challenged bad weather at the curbside market on Broad Street, shouting and gesticulating in order to communicate their transactions. At the time of Petrocelli’s photograph, recently built skyscrapers already towered high over the streets, dwarfing the New York Stock Exchange, the neoclassical building on the left side of the picture, and the Federal Hall National Memorial, on Wall Street, in the background.
 This figure’s protruding abdomen allowed room for the insertion of various medicines by an nganga (ritual specialist) to activate the spirit force reached through the figure. These ingredients were sealed in a cavity behind the tack at the navel. The figure’s oily surface is probably the result of rubbing with palm oil or fat obtained from crushed termite queens.
 Israel Litwak was born in Odessa, then part of Russia. He emigrated to the United States in 1903, settling in Brooklyn and working as a cabinetmaker. He began to paint after retiring at age sixty-eight. Litwak recorded the urban scene as well as place visited on vacations such as the subject shown here. Crawford Notch in the White Mountains of New Hampshire had often been celebrated by nineteenth-century, but Litwak's image is very much his own invention. "One achieves good painting by imagination, talent, patience and a lot of hard work," he wrote. "I look . . . just to get an idea; then I go home and make it the I want it, not the way it is."
 In 1944, Isamu Noguchi designed this low glass-topped table resting on organic-shaped walnut forms. To create it, he returned to the design of a unique object he had made in the late 1930s and revised it for manufacture by the Herman Miller company. Here, transparency is combined with balance, as the top is unfixed and the two support legs hinge at a single point.
 Grace Chapella’s designs are inspired by archaeological vessels from the ancient Hopi site of Sityakti, which dates from the fourteenth to the fifteenth century. The butterfly symbolizes man’s spiritual transformation. Mark Tahbo, an accomplished potter and Chapella’s great grandson, interprets the jar’s designs as symbolic of water’s life-giving cycle: the butterflies indicate a burst of life after the spring rains; the wave patterns dotted with cross forms are cornfields surrounded by water; the jagged peaks are the three Hopi mesas in northern Arizona; and the black fingerlike forms are prayer feathers used in rain ceremonies. Los diseños de Grace Chapella están inspirados en vasijas arqueológicas del antiguo sitio Hopi de Sityakti, el cual data del siglo catorce al siglo quince. La mariposa simboliza la transformación espiritual del hombre. Mark Tahbo, alfarero experto y nieto de Chapella, interpreta los diseños de la jarra como símbolos del ciclo del agua como fuente de vida: las mariposas indican una explosión de vida después de las lluvias de primavera; los diseños ondulados jaspeados con forma de cruz son campos de maíz rodeados por agua, los picos serrados son las tres mesas Hopi al norte de Arizona; y las formas negras que semejan dedos son plumas de oración usadas en ceremonias de lluvia.
 One can witness a wide variety of masquerades addressing issues of social well-being, protection, and health, as well as personal and spiritual concerns, in the Ogoni communities of southeastern Nigeria in which Zina Saro-Wiwa works.Elu masks, such as this one, are danced by young members of secret men’s societies that have social, religious, or governmental functions. The small masks are attached to cone-shaped caps of fiber and cloth that cover the heads of the dancers. They are usually danced at annual festivals or at funerals of members of the societies. As Saro-Wiwa notes, Elu is an older, and more delicate, form of Ogoni masquerade than the newer genre in which she has worked.
 Rockwell traveled to Boston with Saturday Evening Post art editor Ken Stuart to photograph fans during a doubleheader between the Boston Braves and the visiting Chicago Cubs at Braves Field. Additional images taken in the studio were used to fill out the jeering crowd. Rockwell himself can be found in the upper left corner of the painting. The artist typically used oil paints for his final work, but this is a rare example done in watercolor.
 Taken in 1940, these photographs capture women in Harlem who rejected the limitations of domesticity. In Street Scene 2, there is a clear assertiveness about the standing woman, with her left arm holding a stack of newspapers and her right hand on her hip. In Lady and Lamp, the subject’s reclining posture and distanced gaze are juxtaposed with her formal attire, suggesting the need to unwind after a long day of work. Like other New York City neighborhoods at the time, Harlem was still recovering from poverty, overcrowding, and other devastating symptoms of the Great Depression. Details in these photographs, such as the ripped fabric on the arms of the chair and the “Furnished Room” si, hint gently at the harsh conditions that these modern urban women were up against.
 This work is the final design for a twenty-six- foot mural for the Nabrit Science Hall at Texas Southern University. John Biggers described its subject as “the interdependence of living organisms in the balance of nature, and the relationship of all organisms to one another through the long line of evolutionary descent.” Biggers centered the image on an essential earth mother. Throughout, he paired oppositional references to life and death (winter and summer), male and female (the two nudes), and Africa and America (in vignettes of harvest and sowing). A leading twentieth-century African American painter and muralist, Biggers drew inspiration from the Mexican Mural Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s. He also infused the composition with the kind of organic, cellular design that was so current in midcentury American art.
 This personal shrine reflects the great value the Igbo place on individual achievement. Personal shrines are created in the form of figures known as ikenga to honor the power and skills of a person's right hand, as the right hand holds the hoe, the sword, and the tools of craftsmanship. The basic form of an ikenga is a human figure with horns symbolizing power, sometimes reduced to only a head with horns on a base.
 Because of its low cost and easy care, plastic attracted both consumer and designer in the postwar era. Russel Wright worked with the chemical company American Cyanamid to develop a line of dinnerware from its patented plastic, Melamine. Although that venture was not successful, Wright soon found other companies to produce his designs for plastic dinnerware. Originally intended for institutional use, plastic dinnerware also found a place at home, and by 1957 Wright’s Residential line, produced by Northern Industrial Chemical, had door-to-door sales of $4 million.
 The undulating lines of the wooden bowl shown here evoke a jellyfish in motion, or a leaf curling in the summer sun. Russel Wright experimented with these curving, biomorphic shapes in several media and clearly found them interesting in their own right. Although neither easy to make nor particularly suited to their purpose, these bowls were, however, wonderfully playful and suggestive of nature to the consumers he targeted.
 The small pangolin (a mammal with a scaly hide that protects itself by coiling into a ball) is worn by the members of Bwami’s Ngandu and Yananio grades. When associated with hats, the pangolin symbolizes piety and respect.
 This hat would only have been worn by initiates to Kindi, the highest level of Bwami. Tail hair of an elephant, a metaphor for Kindi, crowns the hat. European-made buttons began to replace cowrie shells as prestige items on such Bwami paraphernalia as the Western presence grew in eastern Congo in the early twentieth century.
 Growing up on the urban terrain of concrete sidewalks, Brooklyn children and teenagers have long embraced skating as a pastime. In 1950 N. Jay Jaffee photographed a young skater as she extended her arm out to gain balance independent of her father’s hold. Vincent Cianni’s 1995 image captures a graceful moment of a teenage boy midair. The backgrounds of these images reveal changing textures of the neighborhood landscapes: felt hats with fur trim and arched glass storefront windows in the former, and baggy T-shirts and graffiti scrawled along a block in the latter. Although taken forty-five years apart, these photographs display skating as a communal and enjoyed act for Brooklyn youth.
 In the past, this child’s rocking horse was often attributed to the influential American architect Philip Johnson. However, recent scholarship has revealed this to be a half-truth. In fact, it was the idea of another Philip Johnson, artistic director of the toy company Creative Playthings. He suggested it to Gloria Caranica, a recent graduate of Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute he had just hired.
 This type of statue with multiple heads, called ginin, was commissioned by a group of individuals with a shared lineage, to be placed on an ancestral altar. It represents solidarity and the protection of the family, with one face looking in each of the cardinal directions from which danger might come.
 Dorr Bothwell’s Memory Machine recalls the Surrealist roots of much postwar art. In this eerie, dreamlike landscape, the central form suggests a futuristic television set, supplier and preserver of modern memories. Dorr (or Doris) Bothwell worked and taught in the San Francisco Bay Area, another urban center that was a focus of art production in the forties and fifties.
 The Biombo have been strongly influenced politically and culturally by their neighbors to the north, the Kuba. Like Kuba masks, Biombo masks are worn at funerals and initiations. Masks in both traditions have large slit eyes and painted geometric patterns on the forehead, cheeks and chin. The muted red color seen here is more characteristic of Biombo masks, however.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 Agbogho mmwo, or "maiden spirit," masks are worn by men at festivals that honor important deities. They represent the Igbo ideal of female beauty: small, balanced features, elaborate hairstyles, and delicate tattoos. The men who dance agbogho mmwo masks wear colorful, tight-fitting fiber costumes, entertaining the crowd with exaggerated versions of women's dances.
 Graciela Iturbide is one of the best-known Mexican photographers of the last four decades. The images in this gallery represent series from different parts of Mexico, of which the most important is her breakthrough photoessay Juchitán of the Women (1979–86). In a documentary style notable for its humanistic grace, the series focuses on the indigenous Zapotec people in the town of Juchitán, in southeastern Mexico, where women dominate all aspects of social life, from the economy to religious rituals. The most emblematic image of the series, Our Lady of the Iguanas, shows the power and dignity of a Zapotec woman, who carries on her head live iguanas that form a bizarre crown. Four Fishes shows a woman displaying fish for sale from the private space of her home, the clay and straw of the wall echoing the scales of the fish.Like her teacher, the photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo (at one time the husband of Lola Alvarez Bravo, whose work hangs nearby), Iturbide portrays Catholic traditions intertwined with pre-Hispanic rites and superstitions, showing a culture in constant flux. Approaching her subjects directly and frontally, Iturbide represents a dreamlike reality with great compassion, or, to use the artist’s own word, “complicity.”
 This group of plaques shows the steps in the process for making cloisonné. Technically, cloisonné employs the diverse skills of painting, engraving, metalworking, casting, and firing. To create designs on metal vessels, enclosures made of bronze or copper called cloisons (French for “partitions”) are bent to the desired pattern and either pasted or soldered onto the body. Enamels are essentially glass, colored with metal oxides, that is ground to a powder, mixed with water, and placed as a paste inside the cloisons. The vessel is then fired at a low heat between 1280 and 1328 degrees Fahrenheit. During firing, the enamel may shrink; after cooling, the process is repeated and re-fired until the cells are completely filled with fused enamel.
 Europe's name, and much of its culture and worldview, is rooted in the Greco-Roman classical tradition. In fact, the continent is named after the Phoenician princess Europa of Greek mythology, who was seduced by the god Zeus in the form of a white bull. In antiquity, "Europa" appeared on world maps to designate Europe, or all known land masses north of the Mediterranean. In this eroticized version of the myth of Europa and the bull, Carl Milles revived the ideal classical nude. Here, Europa dominates Zeus, clutching the bull’s curling tongue.
 Unlike the smooth, high glazes on contemporaneous pieces by Eva Zeisel and Russel Wright, the textured, organic surface of Ben Seibel’s teapot and celery dish recalls the green glazes used earlier in the century on Arts and Crafts wares. Raymor dinnerware, a pioneering line in the marketing of modernist design to Americans, enabled those with modest means to buy good design at affordable prices.
 Ted Hallman has been at the vanguard of modern textile design since the late 1950s, when he began to combine natural fibers with acrylic, a relatively new material at the time that had been developed for military use during World War II. The juxtaposition of natural fibrers with the luminous new synthetic material was wholly original at the time. A nearly identical hanging by Hallman was included in the seminal 1969 exhibition Objects USA, which introduced Americans to variety of new designs of the emerging craft movement and helped to bridge the perceived aesthetic gap between so-called craft and fine arts.

 This showgirl, with her direct, heavy-lidded gaze and rouged face, is an example of the “new woman” of the 1920s. Her stance, with turned-out leg and arms akimbo, imply the new and highly sexualized dances popular during the Roaring Twenties. John Carroll alludes to the lively, angular rhythms of popular jazz through the repeated and patterned form of the musician, whose face suggests the shape of an African mask—linking jazz to African culture.
 Gelede masks, such as this one, are worn by male Yoruba dancers at festivals honoring the women of the community, living and dead, especially the powerful Great Mothers, including both the elderly women of the community and the ancestors of Yoruba society. The gelede performances entertain and educate, and document elements of everyday life, such as the woman’s head tie in this example. Through their movements, gelede dancers express Yoruba ideals of male and female behavior.
 Born Joseph Ruiz, in Louisiana, José de Rivera was an important abstract sculptor of the mid-twentieth century. His career culminated with the commission for a large-scale outdoor sculpture for the Mall in Washington, D.C. As with Alexander Calder, the most famous Aamerican abstract sculptor of the last century, de Rivera seems to have made jewelry for most of career but never actively retailed it. This abstract, biomorphic brooch is made of stainless steel, his preferred material for his sculpture but a relatively unusual choice for American jewelry in the mid-twentieth century. The historical importance of the brooch is heightened by rare documentation. In 1947, de Rivera made two brooches for his sister-in-law Elva Ruiz, who was married to his half brother Gordon, and his niece Muriel. Iin a letter to Elva, de Rivera terms the pieces “sculpture brooches” and adds that “I hope that you will like the shapes and wear them—also that they will give you some pleasure.”
 Like many toys, doll’s houses teach children how to live and behave in the adult world. In offering up the entire domestic world at a glance, doll’s houses also reflect, in particular, how objects surround human lives and exert their influence on us.This doll’s house was designed by Gerrit Rietveld, one of the most important furniture designers, architects, and advocates of modernism in the early twentieth century. It was made for the children of the Jesse family, whom he was visiting at the time. Here, the children—Anita and Matcheld—could envision a pared-down lifestyle, surrounded by tasteful modern objects, in the postwar world.
 This peyote rattle was played during Native American Church ceremonies, which combine Native and Christian beliefs. Peyote is a hallucinogenic cactus that is ritually ingested in tea or dried form to induce visions, which are believed to help achieve more harmony with the universe. The gourd symbolizes the world, and the sound it makes represents prayers. The gourd’s zigzag decoration symbolizes Christ’s crown of thorns. The handle’s beaded lightning design, which signifies man’s ability to ascend from earth into heaven, is encircled by a red horsehair fringe that represents the rays of the sun at sunrise, the hour when Christ arose from the dead. The medal attached to the handle reads, “Behold the heart of Jesus is with me.”Esta maraca de peyote se tocaba durante ceremonias de la Iglesia Nativo Americana, en la que se combinan creencias nativas y cristianas. El peyote es un cactus alucinógeno que se ingiere ritualmente en forma de té o seco para inducir visiones, las cuales se cree que ayudan a alcanzar mayor armonía con el universo. La calabaza simboliza el mundo, y el sonido que produce representa a las plegarias. La decoración zigzagueante de la calabaza simboliza la corona de espinas de Cristo. El diseño relampagueante de las cuentas en el mango, el cual significa la habilidad el hombre para ascender desde la tierra al cielo, está rodeado por un borde rojo de crin de caballo que representa los rayos del sol al amanecer, la hora en que Cristo se levantó de entre los muertos. La medalla sujeta al mango dice, “Contemplad que el corazón de Jesús está conmigo.”
 The painter of this hanging scroll, best known for his landscapes, was a descendant of Qing dynasty (1644–1911) royalty. He received a privately tutored classical education that included training in painting and calligraphy, and he excelled at both. He began studying painting formally at the age of thirty, and as was the custom at the time, he learned by copying masterpieces in the royal collection.
 The vegetable-shaped salt and pepper shakers and the curvilinear flask are splendid examples of the Aesthetic Movement style, which appeared strikingly new and modern to consumers at the time. The form of the shakers was inspired by realistic Japanese metal objects with which Americans were just becoming familiar, and their maker used a newly invented process to patinate the silver to resemble weathered copper. The irregular, ergonomic contour and dense Southwestern landscape of the flask would have also seemed quite daring to the original purchaser. In contrast, the all-over, hard-edged design of the later flask evokes the emerging, dynamic skyscraper skyline of big cities, and the unadorned, pyramidal forms of the later salt and pepper shakers have a timeless quality. While all of these objects were progressive when made, only the later ones still speak the language of modern design.

 This complete dance costume shows how masks are normally one part of a larger ensemble. The mask is sewn directly onto the costume of looped bark and fiber, which fits tightly over the body of the dancer. Seedpod rattles and metal bells added a musical aspect to the performance.Although they are danced by Luvale men, mwana pwevo masks depict women. In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.
 Born in remote Roswell, New Mexico, Peter Hurd established his home at Sentinel Ranch, in nearby San Patricio, by 1940 and devoted himself to painting the area’s distinctive landscape. Hurd had been experimenting with the medium seen here—egg tempera (an egg-based, water-soluble paint mixture) applied to gesso-coated panels—since the early 1930s. Derived from Italian Renaissance practice, the method allowed him to achieve a brilliancy of color and “flatness” that he believed were otherwise attainable only with watercolors.
 This aerial photograph of the atomic bomb blast over the Japanese city of Nagasaki was taken on August 9, 1945, documenting the event that led to the end of the war in the Pacific only days later. Paradoxically, the mushroom cloud, so widely understood as an emblem of death and destruction, took the shape of a living form, seeming to resemble the stem and flattened cap of a common toadstool.
 In 1923 Ilya Bolotowsky immigrated with his family to New York from Saint Petersburg. By 1936 he had completed his training at the National Academy of Design, painted his first nonobjective work, and become a founding member of the American Abstract Artists group. Opalescent Vertical is a nearly monochromatic meditation on straight lines and pure forms inspired by the art of Piet Mondrian; abstractions like this one would have been denounced at the time in the Soviet Union, where the censors only recognized Socialist Realism as true Soviet art.
 At the age of seventy-one, May Wilson left rural Maryland and a decades-long marriage for New York City, where she took up residence at the Chelsea Hotel. Because she was generations older than the avant-garde artists she was drawn to, and being largely self-taught, Wilson acquired the nickname “Grandma Moses of the Underground.” In her Ridiculous Portraits, Wilson collaged ludicrous photo-booth self-portraits onto images she collected from picture postcards, reproductions of famous paintings, mainstream magazines, and soft-core pornography. Produced as personal mementos and often exchanged through the mail with other artists as gifts, her Ridiculous Portraits attacked sexism, ageism, and the cult of beauty with a wry sense of absurdity.
 Although little is known about this figure, its hairstyle, ridged in front and worked into small circles in back, and small scars carved across the brow and along the edge of the jaw indicate it is of Zande origin. Such decorative markings, either on art objects or living persons, are clues to group affiliation, rank, and status.
 Modernizing the Urban Landscape By the late 1920s, signs of modernization and industrialization were intruding on the residential neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights, where Isabel Lydia Whitney grew up. The Emerald Tower and The Blue Peter are part of a series of works Whitney painted about 1927 of the changing area. Exhibited in 1928, the series was praised for its honest depiction of the American scene and “the poignancy of transition.” In The Emerald Tower, the iconic Brooklyn Bridge is relegated to the far distance, and the painting is dominated instead by the new Squibb building, part of a manufacturing plant for a pharmaceutical company. The masts, smokestacks, and rigging seen in The Blue Peter hint at the encroachment of waterfront commerce.

 Chaim Soutine’s passion for painting led him from a Lithuanian Jewish ghetto in modern Belarus to the art academies of Minsk and, ultimately, Paris. In the French capital, he turned his back on the prevailing avant-garde style of Cubism and embraced the expressive manner of Rembrandt and Goya, whose works were then on view in the Louvre. In Still Life, Gladiolas Soutine brings together the expressive brushstrokes of the Old Masters with the brilliant color and flattened compositions of Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse.
 In a departure from the vivid hues of his sun-drenched scenes, Matisse focuses here on the muted earth tones of a light-dappled forest. He renders the angled trees in long brushstrokes in a range of browns, allowing the substantial trunks to taper and dematerialize in lightly sketched, ghostly passages at the top. By contrast, the painter creates a hint of sky by daubing a thick, lightly blended mix of blue and white over the branches and foliage. While using a vertically oriented canvas, Matisse provides a sense of spatial recession with a path punctuated by pools of light.
 This figure most likely embodies a "spirit spouse"—the husband or wife every person is said to have had before birth. Through dreams, misfortune, and other signs, a person may learn that his or her spirit spouse feels neglected or jealous. One way to appease the spirit is to commission a carved figure of it and carefully nurture it with food offering and perhaps bathe and rub it with oil.
 The ikupasuy is a sacred object used for prayer. The worshipper dips the sharper end into rice wine (sake) or millet beer, and then sprinkles drops of the liquor. The ikupasuy is believed to be a medium for sending a message to a spirit or god. Delicately carved in relief on plain wood, ikupasuy show numerous design variations. They were sometimes lacquered by neighboring Japanese.
 Max Weber painted this small canvas the year after his marriage, and some scholars have attributed the quiet, decorative sensibility of this and other of his works to the calming influence of domestic life. In this Cubist rendering of a cellist, the figure's closed eyes hint at the ecstasies of making music. The shadowy profile of a woman's head that helps to define the musician's torso and merges with the cello may rely on a traditional iconography in which the curved shapes of the instrument were metaphors for the female form.
 Manuel Alvarez Bravo grew up during the Mexican Revolution (1910−20), a formative period that strengthened his sense of kinship with his homeland. During this time he was introduced to the medium of photography, and he bought his first camera in 1924. Initially working in the Pictorialist tradition, Alvarez Bravo started to experiment with abstract compositions in the late 1920s. In 1927 he befriended the Italian photographer Tina Modotti, who had been living and working in Mexico since 1923, and he later took over her job as a staff photographer at the magazine Mexican Folkways. This post helped him cultivate his own vision, as he developed emblematic themes of Mexican identity blended with unconscious imagery reflecting dreams and chance. In this photograph, Alvarez Bravo uses the everyday to create a compelling vision of Mexico’s urban landscape. The horizontal expanse of wall centers the layered composition, separating the world above from the one below. Two figures, seemingly unaware of each other, pass on the empty street, while stark white laundry hangs in the domestic space above, its brightness creating a link to the woman’s package below. Despite the solidity of the wall, the passersby and flowing fabric suggest the ephemerality of this fleeting moment.
 This sculpture of a young girl, posed as the young goddess Diana with her dog and bow and arrows, demonstrates how Paul Manship sought to meld ideal form inspired by classical Greek and Roman sculpture with a distinctly modern simplicity. He exercised careful control in forming the regularized volumes and polished surface, and added a touch of delicacy with the gilt detailing on the costume and hair. Vivian St. George was the only child of the Irish painter Sir William Orpen and the married American heiress Evelyn St. George. Manship received the portrait commission through his friend the American painter John Singer Sargent, with whom he lived briefly in London in the early 1920s.
 Although Francois Jourdain was known primarily as a painter, he was also an accomplished designer and a founding member of the Union des Artistes Modernes, an important group of avant-garde designers. This adjustable chair is rendered in the Art Moderne style, which is characterized by simple, bold curves. The use of exotic mahogany and cane alludes to the French colonial empire, still partially intact during this period. The chair was manufactured by Jourdain’s own firm, Les Ateliers Modernes.
 When the American photographer Berenice Abbott returned to New York in 1929 after nearly a decade in France, she found a city transformed by modern life. After the Works Progress Administration was established a few years later, she was hired to document the city, producing a large number of often dramatically composed images reflecting its changing features. In this image, Abbott photographed the Trinity and U.S. Realty Buildings (1904−07) on Broadway and Thames Street in the southern part of Manhattan. Older buildings and warehouses sit in the shadow of twentieth-century office towers. Abbott’s steep perspective emphasizes the contrasts in scale and the break between old and new.
 In the late 1950s and early 1960s Idelle Weber began adapting the style of eighteenth-century silhouette portraiture to the Pop idiom. All of the artist’s works included here feature this approach, which imbues her subjects with an anonymous, everyman character. Subjects like Ben Casey, the doctor-hero of a melodramatic 1960s television series, become flat representations of cultural stereotypes; for Weber, the literal flatness of the figures is analogous to the superficial renderings of pop culture characters. In other examples, Weber depicts the quotidian—people on an escalator or skipping rope—with a cold precision. In Munchkins I, II & III, Weber portrays nondescript businessmen in New York’s PanAm (now MetLife) building, one of the world’s largest office buildings at the time, in the middle of the drudgery of their daily commute.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
Chapultepec, or “Grasshopper Hill,” was the first Mexica settlement in the Valley of Mexico, and this carved aquamarine grasshopper pendant may have a symbolic association with the site. Located on the western shore of Lake Texcoco, Chapultepec Hill was a source of fresh water for the capital city of Tenochtitlán. It was also a sacred mountain shrine for Mexica rulers, who had their portraits carved in the rock cliffs. For the Mexica, grasshoppers signified the end of the rainy season, when crops started to grow. Chapultepec, o “Cerro Saltamontes,” fue el primer asentamiento Mexica en el Valle de México, y este pendiente en forma de saltamontes de aguamarina tallada puede tener una asociación simbólica con el lugar. Ubicado en la costa oeste del Lago Texcoco, el cerro de Chapultepec era una fuente de agua fresca para la ciudad capital de Tenochtitlán. Era también un santuario de montaña sagrado para los gobernantes Mexica, quienes hacían tallar sus retratos en los acantilados de piedra. Para los Mexica, los saltamontes significaban el fin de la temporada lluviosa, cuando los cultivos comenzaban a crecer.
 This painting commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad and the third imam, or leader, of the Shica Muslims. Husayn was killed by the forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I (r. 680–683) in the desert of Karbala in central Iraq in 680 c.e. This battle emphasizes the divide between the Sunni and Shica branches of Islam; Husayn led a resistance against what the Shica Muslims believed was the Umayyads’ illegitimate rule. The focus of this painting is Husayn’s half brother, cAbbas, mounted on a white horse as he stabs a member of Yazid’s army. Individual episodes related to the agonies suffered by Husayn and his companions leading up to and during the battle are illustrated in smaller-scale vignettes on the left. The hereafter is shown at the right, with Husayn and his companions in heaven above and their opponents in hell below.“Coffeehouse” Paintings Paintings such as The Battle of Karbala show how the monumental genre, developed for the Zand and Qajar courts (see paintings displayed nearby), was reinterpreted for popular audiences during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This account of Husayn’s martyrdom inspired annual reenactments through ceremonial processions and the tacziya, the ritual theater of Iran. Narrative paintings served as portable backdrops, or pardas (curtains), that could be rolled up and transported from location to location, where a reciter (pardadar) would point to images as he recounted the story. As they were also presented in coffeehouses, such canvases are commonly referred to as qahvakhana, or “coffeehouse,” paintings.
 During most of her life, Ruth Bernhard was interested in depicting the female nude. In this iconic image, one of Bernhard’s most widely recognized and a seminal work of twentieth-century photography, her masterful handling of light and form is put on display. The seemingly sleeping model is framed within a box, emphasizing the horizontal element of the composition and contrasting rectangular regularity with the flow of organic lines. Her left arm breaks away from this constraining enclosure, however, and reaches out of the box in a more comfortable stretch. The play of light and shadow enhances the contours of the body while diffusing the perception of the box, and the body seems to disappear, receding into deep shadows.
 ART OF PRESENTING GENDERArt can play a role in articulating and enacting gender identities, both openly and more subtly. This stool and figure display their respectively male and female bodily sexual characteristics quite directly. The stool would have been used by a Lobi man of high status, with its phallic “foot” protruding to convey his virility and authority. The figure, dedicated to the Yoruba cult of Shango, the orisha (god) of thunder, emphasizes female characteristics of breasts and hairdo. In addition, the bowl held by the figure has sexual and reproductive associations. The two headrests are everyday objects with the same function, though their differing forms are based on the gender of the user. The blocklike form of the man’s headrest contrasts with the more slender form of the woman’s. Even everyday objects such as these can subtly reinforce a strict, binary concept of gender. In addition to cradling the head and protecting often elaborate coiffures during sleep, headrests also serve as emblems of status.
 Victor Gruen, a revolutionary genius in the field of corporate branding and marketing, is now best known as the architect of America’s first enclosed shopping mall. He created this light fixture for Barton’s Bonbonnière, a candy store founded by a fellow Austrian Jewish émigré at Broadway and 81st Street in Manhattan in 1938. In addition to giving the store a large plate-glass façade to entice customers inside, Gruen completely integrated the store’s interior design and retail components, decorating the candy boxes and shopping bags with small colored dots that echoed the painted disks of the lights. A great critical success, the formula was repeated in more than fifty identical stores nationwide by 1952.The ceiling lights were clearly inspired by the kinetic metal mobiles that sculptor Alexander Calder began making in Paris in the 1930s. They are an excellent example of the blurring of the boundaries between the so-called high and low arts that characterized the twentieth century.
 Although experiments with the notion of wireless communication date back to the mid-nineteenth century, the first radio transmission in the United States occurred in 1920. New technology required new forms, and as the household radio rapidly gained in popularity throughout the twenties and thirties, many designers devised different forms. Walter Dorwin Teague’s radios from the mid-1930s are among the most iconic early designs. The streamlined, curving silhouettes of his radios epitomize the Art Moderne, or Art Deco, style that began about 1925. The striking blue mirrored glass seen here was a clever use of a preexisting material to enhance the radio’s sense of newness.
 Charles Eames experimented with molded shell forms for chairs before the war, collaborating with Eero Saarinen on an award-winning chair design in 1940. These experiments were put to good use during the war when Eames and his colleagues used molded plywood technology to develop a lightweight leg splint and a litter for soldiers injured in the field. Just as a chair seat needed to conform to the human body, so did a splint. The ability to mold plywood efficiently into curving shapes had important implications for postwar design.
 One of the few American students of the famous French sculptor Auguste Rodin, Malvina Hoffman also studied equestrian sculpture briefly with the Croatian artist Ivan Mestrovic (1881-1962). While she worked with him, Mestrovic did her portrait and Hoffman modeled what eventually became this over-life-size statue of her mentor. Clad in an open-collared smock and loose trousers, the figure peers intently at the lump of clay waiting to be modeled in his hand. This monumental image portrays Mestrovic, who later settled in the United States, as a heroic artist at the height of his creative powers.
 A dancer and performer himself, Richard Bruce Nugent had a deep affinity for the expressive possibilities of the human body in motion. In this striking image, he depicted dancers and plants as flat, stylized forms rendered in black silhouettes. In the mid-1920s, inspired in part by African art, several artists of the Harlem Renaissance embraced a silhouette aesthetic. As suggested in a verse of Nugent’s poem “Shadow” (1925), the silhouette also had personal significance for the artist, who was African American: Silhouette A silhouette am IOn the face of the moon Lacking colorOr vivid brightness But defined all the clearerBecause I am dark Black on the face of the moon.
 NATIVE AMERICAN PUEBLO POTTERYPottery making was practiced in the southwestern United States for at least two thousand years. Zuni and Cochiti potters created the three vessels here: two water jars and one drum jar, which would have had a hide stretched over the top for beating with drumsticks. Historically, women were the potters, collecting their own clays, coiling and finishing each pot by hand, and firing the pieces in open fires.Pots were often traded and exchanged between pueblos, so that new ideas were constantly being generated. During the 1880s the advent of the railroad brought an influx of trading posts and tourists into the Southwest and entrepreneurial potters began selling to the non-Native market. Today, both male and female potters continue to form traditional works as well as generate exciting new forms of Pueblo pottery.
 At the age of seventy-one, May Wilson left rural Maryland and a decades-long marriage for New York City, where she took up residence at the Chelsea Hotel. Because she was generations older than the avant-garde artists she was drawn to, and being largely self-taught, Wilson acquired the nickname “Grandma Moses of the Underground.” In her Ridiculous Portraits, Wilson collaged ludicrous photo-booth self-portraits onto images she collected from picture postcards, reproductions of famous paintings, mainstream magazines, and soft-core pornography. Produced as personal mementos and often exchanged through the mail with other artists as gifts, her Ridiculous Portraits attacked sexism, ageism, and the cult of beauty with a wry sense of absurdity.
 This Lele mask is closely related to the Kuba mask depicted in Brendan Fernandes’s video As One shown here. The masks chosen for the ballet duet Fernandes composed for As One are known to have been danced in their own distinctive way. The female mask covered with geometric patterns in the video is from the court of the Kuba kingdom, and was originally worn as the face of a female court historian who danced in a carefully choreographed narrative. The Lele make masks that have much in common, both visually and functionally, with those of their neighbors in the central Kuba kingdom, but are much rarer.The Lele sculptor of this mask employed an imaginative and skillful use of pigment to underline volume contrasts such as the convex, almond-shaped eyes—accentuated by multiple eyebrows arranged one atop another—and the pronounced relief of the nose, ears, and scarification marks. Such masks appear principally at the funerals of chiefs and elders but are also used in annual performances that celebrate and teach the history of Lele origins and migrations.

 Historically, Dan society vested political leadership in a council of elders. Masks served as agents of social control, enforcing the council’s rules and orders. The masked figures were believed to be incarnate spiritual beings capable of rendering unbiased judgments. The specific functions of individual masks, once removed from their village contexts, are impossible to determine. Here, the nearly closed eyes and small mouth contrast with those of other masks and probably indicate that this example served in a peacemaking function and generally created harmony in the community. On the other hand, the form of the bu gle mask (no. 2) with projecting eyes and mouth was designed to be deliberately frightening.
 
 Eraminhô are repositories for the souls of the dead. According to Bijagó beliefs, a person’s soul lives on after the body, but only as long as it is remembered by the person’s family. Thus it is necessary to create a repository for the soul and to provide it with sacrifices.
 Margaret Bourke-White was for much of her career the quintessential photojournalist. A major contributor to Life magazine, starting with its inaugural edition in 1936, Bourke-White was the first of dozens of female photojournalists who appeared, and then disappeared, during the golden age of news magazines in the mid-twentieth century. Her precision and strong sense of design were formed while working as an industrial photographer, glamorizing the steel industry and urban architecture. In 1930 Bourke-White was the first Western photographer allowed to take pictures in the Soviet Union. This perfectly composed, beautifully lit photograph shows infants at mealtime in a Soviet orphanage. Light plays on the almost identical heads of the sexually indeterminate three-year-olds, solemnly sharing milk and bread at a child-size table with a spotless white tablecloth.
 To render the three-dimensional volume of the female form, Bradley Walker Tomlin created delicate tonal modulations by dragging and rubbing a Conté crayon across the textured surface of the paper. Intersecting Cubist planes, lightly sketched on the figure’s lower back, hint at an underlying abstract structure, while accents of watercolor around the figure add a decorative touch. Best known for his mature Abstract Expressionist paintings, Tomlin destroyed much of his early work, of which Back is a rare surviving example.
 John Wenger’s view of the amusements at Coney Island (painted his first year as a watercolorist) is extremely lively, owing primarily to the artist’s nervous line and the play of light and color patterns. Born outside of Odessa, Russia, Wenger immigrated to the United States in 1903 and by the twenties was established as a theatrical painter. In his work for the Ziegfeld Follies and the Metropolitan Opera, he honed his skills in designing scenes infused with a dramatic energy.
 A New York sculptor who began to gain recognition for his work in the 1930s, Chaim Gross produced innumerable figure studies in ink and wash on which he based his figurative wood carvings. In this more developed scene done independently of his sculptural work, one still sees the artist’s primary attention to the sculptural outline of forms; color, in the form of watery washes, is added as more of a secondary element.
 A painter, sculptor, educator, and graphic artist, Tom Lias did not achieve the fame of the leading artists of the time. His work nonetheless exemplifies many of the same qualities. Here, Lias unites certain formal characteristics of the period’s painting with the prevalent graphic-design principles in a composition of architectural spaces.

 Although best known as a lithographer of caricatured figure subjects, Adolf Dehn also worked with other media and subjects, including landscape watercolors. Dehn’s primary work in a black-and-white print medium may have led him to emphasize strong contrasts of light and dark, enhanced here by areas of drawing with a soft pencil or chalk. Although his talent for expressive form is also visible, this work is most impressive for Dehn’s dynamic control of the dark washes that broadly but forcefully define the jutting rock cliffs.
 Although born in Germany and educated in New York, Vladimir Kagan was an enthusiastic proponent of Scandinavian design. Opening in 1950, his showroom on Fifty-seventh Street in midtown Manhattan, New York, was one of the first independent design stores to offer both furniture and interior design services in this new style.
 In direct emulation of the famous John Singer Sargent, whom he had met in London, the society portraitist Gordon Stevenson adopted the practice of painting landscapes in watercolor during his summer travels. The lasting impact of Sargent’s innovative approach and technical freedom in the medium—developed during the first decade of the century—is visible in Stevenson’s effort to achieve a similar degree of coloristic brilliance and in his deft manipulation of liquid washes.
 Millard Sheets made this work on the spot while traveling through the Kansas Dust Bowl. (Many midwestern farmlands were destroyed by drought and dust storms in the 1930s, and Sheets stated that “the bleakness in the painting is symbolic of the period.”) With his American subject matter and skillful handling of the medium, the California-based artist earned national acclaim for his watercolors at the time, with critics regularly comparing him to the celebrated masters Winslow Homer and Edward Hopper.
 These sleek modernist versions of Pegasus, the flying horse of classical mythology, once flanked the entrances to the New York City Fire Service Pumping Station that still stands on Neptune Avenue between West Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Streets. The station boosted water pressure for fire fighting in outlying areas of Brooklyn. These four pairs of winged horses arise from stylized curving forms that suggest waves or clouds. Their compact double profiles reflect the Art Deco style of the industrial building whose entrances they once adorned. The streamlined design style was widely used in the 1920s and 1930s.

 The depiction of laboring rice harvesters is typical of the work of Thomas Hart Benton, a leader in the American Scene movement of painting the arose in that late 1920s. Benton and his peers deliberately abandoned European-derived subjects and urban setting in favor of imagery drawn from rural America. Born in Missouri and educated in Chicago and Paris, Benton began to seek out these themes in 1926, during the first of the many trips through the Midwest and the South. Focusing on the broad appeal of the commonplace he described American "types" rather than specific individuals and place, and rendered them in a directly expressive, almost caricatured manner.A verbal description of this work is available through Art Beyond Sight, a guide for people with visual impairments.
 Like many artists at work in the 1930s, Maurice Kish was a labor activist whose subject matter revealed his sympathy for industrial workers. At the time he painted this canvas, Kish was a resident of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He often focused his attention on the massive and filthy coal plants and factories that lined the nearby East River. Here, industrial sites tower over faceless laborers, and all is described in the dull, dark tones indicative of the harsh monotony of their lives.
 The features of this uli figure—the large head with pointed beard, the short legs, and the presence of a penis and breasts—are characteristic of a complex set of mortuary ceremonies that developed in the mountainous central part of New Ireland. These attributes may not have been regarded as the stylized features of a particular person, but rather as the essential components of the aggressive strength and nurturing care required of an ideal ruler.
 Myers often depicted the streets, river piers, parks, and playgrounds of New York’s Lower East Side—a neighborhood then populated mainly by poor European immigrants. He especially enjoyed the exceptional energy and vitality of the open-air markets, writing that “the immigrants merge here with New York.”
 After many years abroad, Joseph Pennell settled in Brooklyn Heights in 1921. His upper-story apartment afforded magnificent views of New York, its waterways, and its bridges—all of which were regular subjects in his art. Pennell achieved the tenebrous effects of this work with aquatint, an etching technique in which the picture is conceived in tone rather than line. Aquatint uses a plate coated with a porous, grainy ground. During the bath, acid bites the underlying metal around the tiny grains, thus creating a subtly patterned area that prints as a tonal wash. Varying the bath time for different sections of the plate results in darker or lighter tones.
 Eugene and Elsie Speicher and Robert and Marjorie Henri were close friends of George and Emma Bellows’s and appear often in lithographs that Bellows made in 1921. Here the women enjoy an intimate conversation on the settee in the Bellowses’ sitting room, while the husbands converse in the background. One of the most talented of Henri’s students, Bellows quickly became a popular member of the Henri circle. Speicher (1883–1962) was another Henri student who had become a successful portraitist.
 Aerodynamic streamlining is characteristic of much American industrial and domestic design of the late 1920s and 1930s. Undecorated, curved designs, as seen here, are well suited to machine production and expressive of speed and change. The vanity and stool are made of chromed metal tubing, an innovation in furniture construction pioneered in the early 1920s by Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus, the seminal German school for modern design. It was still a startling new material a decade later. Although the vanity is gender-specific, this stark, modern interpretation has a limited palette and is made of new materials with hard surfaces. Updating an old form, Kem Weber transformed it for the modern woman.
 ART OF THE BODYThese five artworks from throughout Africa display the range of approaches artists have taken to figural representation. They prove that the Western tradition of naturalism—depicting the body precisely as observed in life—is not even remotely the only possibility open to an artist. The Mossi mask celebrates the female form. While it is not an exact replica of the body, the proportions are relatively balanced. The Yoruba tapper, used with a board to draw images during divinations, was carved with more exaggerated proportions, owing to both the shape of the ivory from which it was carved and the functional requirements of the object. The Fang figure has primarily been reduced to a series of cylinders and circles. The legs and hips are conceived as the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders, echoing the cylindrical reliquary box on which the figure sat. The small Nsapo-Nsapo work and the Salampasu figure take the abstraction of the human form even further by greatly exaggerating the proportions. The Nsapo-Nsapo figure’s thin, extended arms and the Salampasu sculpture’s outthrust chest and flexed shoulders suggest different emotional states for these two protective figures—a tense anxiety, perhaps, in one and a tense readiness in the other.
 The surface of this head is lifelike, but its expression may lead us to contemplate the psychic life at play behind the closed eyes. The sculptor Isamu Noguchi modeled this likeness of his uncle Takagi, a Buddhist priest, in gratitude for his hospitality during the artist’s visit to Tokyo in 1931. One of three casts from the original clay sculpture, the head suggests the “closed-eye vision” achieved through meditation.
 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 William Zorach developed his modernist approach after studying at the progressive Paris art school La Palette. Typical of the work in watercolor that he pursued throughout his career—even after he abandoned oil painting for sculpture in 1922—this magical image was based on a five-month sojourn in Yosemite. Exploiting liquid watercolor washes to create soft-edged forms in gem-like colors, Zorach conveyed the transcendent quality he experienced in that landscape, which he described as “the garden of Eden.”
 Expressive design was always at the heart of Marguerite Zorach’s art. Basing her imagery on some firsthand sketches (in this case made on a trip to Yosemite in 1920), Zorach preferred to work away from her original motifs in nature to achieve a composition independent of direct observation. Employing a decorative approach—with formal patterns and non-naturalistic colors—in a number of media, she initially was best known for her hand-sewn pictorial tapestries, for which her watercolors sometimes served as preparatory designs.
 The art of Karl Schrag, a German émigré to the United States in 1938, was liberated by the war’s end, when he allowed himself to move from politically positioned subjects to the more neutral art of landscape. In 1945 he also began to remake his stylistic approach under the influence of the innovative British printmaker William Stanley Hayter, joining Hayter’s studio, Atelier 17, in Greenwich Village. In both his prints and paintings, Schrag developed a more abstracted use of line with the aim of heightening the sense of motion in the images.

The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 The works in Erwin Hauer’s Continua in the Plane series, of which Intercircles is a part, exhibit a continuity of surface and a sense of potentially infinite expansion. The sculptural forms reveal themselves in various organic patterns as the viewer moves around the work. Although this is an independent piece of sculpture, leading architects and designers of the era, such as Edward Durell Stone, Florence Knoll, and Philip Johnson, incorporated similar works into their interiors as room dividers or light-diffusing walls.
 Popular 1920s burlesque shows featured a newly minted American type—the career chorus girl who was willing to appear barely clad and was able to perform rigorous choreography for a male audience with a taste for machinelike precision. Performers were a favorite subject for the painter Walt Kuhn, who earned extra income as a stage and costume designer for popular entertainments. This chorus girl strikes the quintessential pose of the body-conscious 1920s female, with arms raised and hands behind her head, fully exposing a powdered expanse of chest and shoulders.
 A second-generation American Impressionist, Frederick Carl Frieseke enjoyed an early reputation as a figure painter who, inspired by the figural subjects of Pierre-Auguste Renoir, employed the Impressionist devices of sparkling color and dappled light. Yet many of his compositions, including Le Pouldu Landscape, also express a highly decorative, patterned aesthetic more akin to the works of Nabi artists like Ă?douard Vuillard.The Artist's Daughter is a relatively late work in Frieseke's career and depicts his only child, Frances, one of his favorite models. She is absorbed in the private act of writing in a secluded interior illuminated subtly by sunlight filtered through blinds. Combining the artist's figural interests with an affectionate family portrait, the painting offers an evocative image of subdued color and quiet charm.
 This mask combines many diverse materials to create an image of power. Multiple eyes, warthog tusks, large teeth, and other power symbols such as rifle casings and a beard of authentic and wooden leopard’s teeth form a fierce countenance that frightens away negative forces.
 The Senufo are well known for their elegant sculpture, which is often associated with the Poro, important men's and women's religious society. These figures, often ornamented by body scarification, elaborate coiffures, and jewelry, represent idealized female beauty. This object, called a deble, was used at Poro festivities, such as initiations and funerals. Deble are held by their upper arms and pounded on the ground to mark a rhythm for dancers. The worn arms on this piece show it was used repeatedly.
 Ray Komai's molded plywood chair was manufactured in Brooklyn in 1949, using the latest American technology. Although European designers such as Marcel Breuer and Alvar Aalto designed plywood furniture in the 1930s, it was the Americans Charles and Ray Eames, in the years immediately after World War II, who realized the full potential of this material and bent one sheet of plywood in several directions. Komai's chair adds a sophisticated anthropomorphic twist. If you look closely, the chair's design suggests a human face.
 Bamana masks such as this one are worn and seen only by members of the Komo association, whose members harness the power (nyama) contained in the mask to aid members of the community. Powerful materials—including blood, chewed kola nuts, and millet beer—are applied to the mask, while prayers and sacrifices are offered. The open mouth and the horns, tusks, and porcupine quills symbolize the Komo’s power to punish those who violate its rules.
 In 1959 the Brazilian artist Lygia Clark cofounded Neo-Concretism, a movement that introduced an expressive, participatory component to the rational style of geometric abstraction. Radar-Small is from Clark’s Bichos (Critters) series of sculptures inspired by living organisms and made up of hinged aluminum sheets. Here, the artist intentionally exposes the hinges, which function much as a supportive spinal column for her “living” creations. Clark relied on her viewer to animate the Bichos by opening, closing, and turning them in infinite ways.
 The clean muscularity and precise industrial order presented by Lewis Hine in Power House Mechanic demonstrates the photographer’s shift, in 1919, from a gritty documentary style to what he called “interpretive photography”—an approach intended to raise the stature of industrial workers, who were increasingly diminished by the massive machinery they operated. Despite his concern for the worker, Hine’s use of hand-selected and precisely posed models actually helped to cement the pictorial formulas employed by burgeoning corporate public-relations departments.
 Surrealism, a visual and literary movement founded in 1924, originated as a European response to the First World War. Yves Tanguy painted Surrealist landscapes devoid of human figures throughout his career.Composition and Robe du Matin—created during Tanguy’s self-imposed exile in the United States in the wake of World War II—speak to the irrationality of war and the annihilation of Europe’s people. Using Surrealist free association and unexpected juxtapositions, Tanguy frames vast voids with interlocking forms that resemble body parts and spindly rods. His dreamlike deviations from the natural world reflect Surrealism’s interest in Freudian psychology and the subconscious, and perhaps the postwar landscape of 1946 Europe.
 The Swiss Surrealist Kurt Seligmann explored myth and whimsicality in this painting, where swirling, haunting forms constitute both figures within the landscape and the landscape itself. Mennon refers to a type of butterfly, as well as the father of the god Thor in Norse mythology. The vertical forms suggest the constant movement of a butterfly that, like the legendary Thor, covers many lands on its life journey. Seligmann immigrated to the United States in 1939 to flee the threat of Nazism. He referred to his paintings, inspired by the vast, open terrain he encountered in the American Southwest, as “cyclonic landscapes.”

 In this drawing Isamu Noguchi used a thick paintbrush to apply ink in serpentine lines and slashing strokes. By changing the pressure of his touch and twisting the tip of the brush, he varied the density and width of the outlines over the course of each stroke. Such variations suggest volumetric mass in an otherwise abstracted figure. After studying traditional Chinese brush drawing in Beijing in the early 1930s, Noguchi combined that technique with the reductive approach to form inspired by his mentor, the modernist sculptor Constantin Brancusi. This blending of Eastern and Western influences characterizes the art of Noguchi, who was of Japanese and American descent.
 In this image of a Swiss town blanketed by a heavy snowfall, Beaumont combines a subtle winter palette of whites, grays, and browns with energetic brushwork. He places a black-cloaked figure on a snow-covered track (indicated by gentle modulations in tone), leading the viewer diagonally into the picture and lending a human presence to an otherwise stark scene.
 Here, Pierre Bonnard employs the high vantage point and candid, unidealized approach to the female nude pioneered by his compatriot Degas. Bonnard, however, presents his bather frontally, seated in a full-length bathtub, a luxury not found in many French homes during Degas’s time. His model was his wife, Marthe, whose skin malady required long soaks.
 Using traditional methods of hand-coiled yellow ware and outdoor firing, Nampeyo invented her own abstract designs based on Hopi symbols. This bowl has a stylized eagle tail, abstract bird form, and meandering lines that indicate Hopi migration from the underworld to their homelands. A potter from a young age, Nampeyo later worked with her daughters Annie, Nellie, and Fannie and sold directly through trading-post owner Thomas Keam. In 1905–6 she lived and worked at the Grand Canyon’s Hopi House demonstrating pottery making to tourists.
 The hats in this case were originally worn by initiates into Bwami, the key social organization of Lega society and patron of its great artistic genres. Bwami is a strictly tiered, hierarchical organization through which initiates advance from one state of knowledge to the next.
 The shift in our perception of objects when they are displayed as part of a museum collection can sometimes elevate a practical piece into an art object. On deli counters in the 1940s, this commercial meat slicer would have evoked cleanliness, efficiency, and modernity. In an exhibition, it becomes an almost abstract piece of streamlined design.
 Kenojuak Ashevak’s drawings and prints feature fantastical creatures and bold colors and forms. This captivating image of an arctic owl was among the first prints produced by the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative. It quickly became a Canadian icon, and in 1970 the print was chosen for the country’s commemorative stamp.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

 These Native American objects represent just a few of the items made in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, primarily for sale to dealers and collectors to satisfy the growing market for indigenous products. Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea’a’ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).
 Having established himself in London as an etcher of urban architectural views, Joseph Pennell returned to the United States in 1917 and turned his attention to watercolors of New York subjects. This work is probably one of a series of twenty views titled Out of a Brooklyn Window that Pennell exhibited in the Brooklyn Museum’s 1921 watercolor exhibition. The manner in which Pennell constructed the composition of abbreviated areas of dark and light forms recalls the compositional methods of his English friend and mentor James McNeill Whistler.
 A modernist landscape painter, Oscar Bluemner believed that individual colors embodied specific meanings; red, for example, directly expressed a powerful life force. When the death of his wife in 1926 left him in despair, Bluemner found solace in painting a group of watercolors of vividly toned landscapes with suns and moons that signified the ecstatic transformation of matter into spirit. The atmospheric quality of his watercolor washes infuse his nocturnal subjects with an air of mystery.
 The daughter of prosperous Swiss immigrants, Marie Zimmermann was born in Brooklyn and studied art at the Art Students League and Pratt Institute. Although she was often influenced by Asian and ancient Egyptian art, which she no doubt saw on visits to the Brooklyn Museum, these candlesticks illustrate an affinity with the restrained Anglo-American interpretation of the Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Zimmermann and Elizabeth Copeland, the maker of the nearby box, were among the few women metalsmiths to achieve national fame.
By the time Pierre Legrain designed this stool in the 1920s, the idea of seating furniture as a status symbol had been replaced by the idea that comfort was paramount. In making a stool whose luxury and beauty surpassed its usefulness, Legrain looked back to older ways of thinking. His use of an African model, however, was new and reflected a growing fascination with the arts of Africa among sophisticated Europeans in the 1920s.By turning a traditionally simple African form into a luxury object made of lacquered wood and covered with expensive sharkskin, Legrain reflected the cultural imperialism of his time, when Western artists and designers raided the artistic heritage of the world and remade objects from other cultures to accommodate consumers’ taste.
 
 Although ostensibly a portrait head of a woman from the Caribbean island of Martinique, this sculpture is one of a number of heads based on Malvina Hoffman’s travels through Africa about 1928. The modernized realism of this work signaled a deliberate break with earlier treatments of African subjects ranging from caricature to romanticism. For many years, however, the critical reception of Hoffman’s work remained firmly embedded in racist language and a Eurocentric point of view.
 This headdress is known as zigiren-wunde, or “the new bride.” Entirely secular in nature, it celebrates the role of Baga women in both human and agricultural fertility, and in nurturing the community.The zigiren-wunde is owned and performed by groups of young men solely for entertainment, especially at weddings. The performer wears it on top of the head, grasping the leglike projections at the base of the mask to steady it. These “shoulders” are draped with cloth, leaving the figure’s breasts exposed, and the costume is completed with the addition of a skirt of palm fiber.
 Iginga is a generic Lega term for human figurines owned by the highest-ranking members of Bwami. This example most likely served to mark the right of a specific Lega community to hold higher-level initiation rites. The piece has been cleaned, oiled, and rubbed with white powder many times, giving it a rich patina.
 This female gheonga figure most likely accompanied a male figure in a Bwiti shrine. A gheonga figure represents an ancestor, who is called upon for assistance with problems. Modern Bwiti incorporates animism, veneration of the ancestors, and elements borrowed from Christianity.
 Oötsawihazru Kachina is an Ogre’s Uncle, a so-called White Ogre. These Kachinas are a little more patient than the Black Ogres, such as Chaveyo (seen nearby). Ogres, collectively called Soo’so’yokto, appear near the end of the Powamuya (Bean Dance) ceremony held in February, in which the participating Kachina spirits are implored to carry out purification of all life. Their role as Ogres is to scare people into behaving properly and following the rules. Kachina Oötsawihazru es el Tío de un Ogro, conocido como Ogro Blanco. Estos Kachinas son un poco más pacientes que los Ogros Negros, como Chaveyo (ver Kachina Chaveyo). Ogros, llamados colectivamente Soo’so’yokto, aparecen hacia el final del Powamuya (Danza del Frijol), ceremonia realizada en febrero en la cualse les implora a los espíritus Kachinas participantes la purificación de todo lo vivo. Su rol de Ogros es asustar a la gente para que así se comporten apropiadamente y sigan las reglas.
 Russel Wright created cutlery that both feels good in the hand and presents a sensuous, curving appearance. Designed for production in stainless steel, these pieces reflect a new interest in casual living, with comfort and convenience outweighing outmoded ideas of elegance.

 The child's wheelbarrow is based on a toy that Gerrit Rietveld made in 1923 for the son of J. J. P. Oud, the owner of the armchair also displayed here. The wheelbarrow exemplifies the stylistic characteristics of De Stijl: it is composed of elemental geometric forms—rectangular planes, elongated cylinders, and a disk for the wheel—painted in primary colors and made of inexpensive wood. Revived interest in Rietveld in the mid-twentieth century led to this later production of the wheelbarrow.
 Becoming NewMasquerade is to some extent always “new.” Each performance varies in response to changes in setting, music, costume, audience, and the performers’ movements. However, circumstances sometimes require the invention of totally new types of masquerade to address new issues.Ode-lay is a uniquely urban form of masquerade that developed in Sierra Leone’s capital city of Freetown. This mask likely has its origins in the 1960s or ‘70s, when new genres of film, particularly those from or about Asia, inspired novel mask creations. The crowned central figure on this mask, flanked by two pairs of sinuous snarling serpents, may be directly related to the kung fu movies of the period. The imagery of this mask may also recall that of Mami Wata, a pan-African water goddess recognized throughout West Africa and the Caribbean, whose roots lie in the local adaptation of imagery drawing from India, the Pacific, and Europe.Male Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. The full-body example seen here is a highly unusual artistic reinvention of the gelede form; only about half a dozen are known in Western collections.
 In a rented apartment in Nice, France, Henri Matisse physically distanced himself from Paris and its associations with World War I, the avant-garde style of Cubism, and even his family. There, he focused on Mediterranean light, captured here with fine, parallel hatchings throughout the model’s body. She is a confident nude with an open posture and confrontational gaze, perhaps suggesting Matisse’s interrogation of the traditional role of women in art history as objects of desire.Alice ZhengCuratorial InsightsBrooklyn Museum Teen Mentoring InitiativeSpring 2016
 Josef Albers’s Homage to the Square series is a study of the illusionistic effects of color. Starting with the rigorous geometry of nested squares, Albers created these works by applying paint directly from the tube and spreading it onto the Masonite board with a palette knife. The juxtaposed slabs of color play off one another, as some squares seem to recede into space while others float into the foreground. Albers pursued this study of color and perception from 1950 until his death, producing nearly a thousand canvases in the series.
 This is one of several paintings Pablo Picasso created in quick succession in Paris during World War II. In this fractured bust-length portrait of a woman wearing a veil and broad-brimmed hat, the artist’s abstractions evoke the violence and bleakness of life in the German-occupied French capital.
 Hampatong is a general term for a statue or figure. These figures might have served a number of different purposes. In this instance, since both male and female images are depicted, it is likely that they represent a mythical ancestral couple. Such ancestors are believed to protect a village by warding off evil spirits. Dayak art is distinguished by the incorporation of many, floral motifs and curvilinear designs, as seen on the hats that these figures are wearing.
 To honor deceased family members, villagers kept carved wooden figures to contain the souls of their ancestors in the family house. This seated figure (iene) from Leti has elongated limbs drawn close to the body and rests on a pedestal. The extension from the forehead may indicate the rank of the deceased.
 Arakawa Toyozo, an apprentice of Kitaoji Rosanjin, devoted his life to re-creating Shino and yellow-and-black Seto wares of the Momoyama period. He eventually received the Japanese honor of being designated a Living National Treasure. The donor of this object relates the fascinating story of her meeting with the artist in 1956. Together they viewed the famous Chinese painting of six persimmons (kaki) by the Song artist Mu Ch'i (active thirteenth century), which was on view in an exhibition of treasures in a Japanese museum.Arakawa went back to his studio and fashioned this small incense box in the form of the fruit, firing it with the simple but effective decoration technique known as nezumi-Shino (gray Shino). He then gave it to Mrs. Conant as a memento of their experience.
 This side chair is an intentional, faithful copy of a chair made more than one hundred years earlier by the famous New York City cabinetmaker Duncan Phyfe. Made out of the same expensive materials as the original Phyfe chair, it is an example of the Colonial Revival style that began about the time of the United States centennial in 1876 and continued well into the twentieth century. Out of a desire to define themselves and their place in the world, Americans began to look back proudly to their past. They then began to build colonial-style houses and fill them with early American–style furniture such as this chair.
 Augustus Aaron Wilson, a retired lighthouse keeper, is best known for his duck decoys and other small carvings. When the Ringling Brothers circus came to town in 1931, he was inspired by Emyr, said to be the largest tiger in captivity, to carve these tigers from salvaged railroad ties and telephone poles that he kept in his barn. The smaller of these two works is thought to be the earlier attempt.
 Because of its low cost and easy care, plastic attracted both consumer and designer in the postwar era. Russel Wright worked with the chemical company American Cyanamid to develop a line of dinnerware from its patented plastic, Melamine. Although that venture was not successful, Wright soon found other companies to produce his designs for plastic dinnerware. Originally intended for institutional use, plastic dinnerware also found a place at home, and by 1957 Wright’s Residential line, produced by Northern Industrial Chemical, had door-to-door sales of $4 million.

 Though separated by several generations, Jervis McEntee and Marsden Hartley both employed emotive styles to express personal impressions of landscape rather than faithful transcripts of nature. In A Cliff in the Katskills (at left), McEntee rendered a well-known natural landmark in the Catskill Mountains with thickly applied daubs of paint, in a departure from the studious detail typical of mid-nineteenth- century landscape painting. The drama of McEntee’s painting, with its imposing boulder and foreboding clouds, is echoed in Marsden Hartley’s seascape. A Maine native, Hartley used an expressionist style of rough brushstrokes, bold outlines, and compressed space to depict the churning sea crashing against the rocky shore.

 The Great Depression imposed severe emotional and financial hardships on many people, including Hartley, who in 1935 was living on sixty cents a day. Relief came when a patron sent the exhausted painter to Bermuda, where the tropical atmosphere revived his flagging spirits. There he concentrated on fish and floral still-life subjects
 Often there is an occult attraction in the very shape of a rock as sheer abstract form. It fascinates with a queer atavistic nostalgia, as either a remote memory or a stirring impulse from the depth of the unconscious. My aim is to produce a sculpture feeling as direct and swift as drawing, a sculpture with such ease, freedom and simplicity that it hardly feels carved, but rather to have always been there. . . . —John Flannagan
 Hartley's penchant for the poetic was satisfied by the boulder-strewn landscape of Dogtown Common, an abandoned agricultural community near Gloucester, Massachusetts, whose origins dated to the seventeenth century. The desolate aspects of the scenery fired his imagination, and he later described the place as "a cross between Easter Island and Stonehenge--essentially druidic in its appearance--it gives the feeling that an ancient race might turn up at any moment and renew an ageless rite there."
 By 1940, Mark Rothko—deeply impressed by the European Surrealists, some of whom came to this country during World War II—integrated their technique of automatic drawing and their interest in myth into his own work and moved away from the direct representation seen in his earlier art. Reflecting on this time, Rothko later said: "It was with utmost reluctance that I found that the figure could not serve my purposes … but a time came when none of us could use the figure without mutilating it." Rothko's work of the mid-1940s is an amalgam of Surrealism and abstraction. Vessels of Magic anticipates these works with horizontal registers on the paper's surface broken only by passages of imagery and gesture. The vessel forms may suggest the artist's interest in classical mythology, while the image's watery quality has a primordial, mythic nature that suggests something of humankind's origins as well as the power of magic.
 Utilizing traditional hand-coiling techniques, vessel forms, and open-trench firing, Maria Martinez invented a unique style of pottery featuring black-on-black designs (as seen here), which had never been done before. Martinez began potting to provide income for her family, collaborating with her husband, Julian, and later her son, Popovi Da, as painters. She eventually became world-famous, attracting visits from Japanese masters who wanted to learn her techniques. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., invited her to help with the dedication of New York’s Rockefeller Plaza in 1933.
 Ad Reinhardt said of his flat, geometric abstract paintings: "The content is not in a subject matter or story but in the actual painting activity." Although Reinhardt was a contemporary of the Abstract Expressionists, his art differs greatly from that of Jackson Pollock or Willem de Kooning, whose works are composed of random, gestural brushstrokes. Rather, in paintings like Untitled (Composition #704), Reinhardt's control over his canvas is revealed in solid bricklike blocks of color. The work is strictly composed to deny depth and affirm symmetry.
 THE JARVIS COLLECTIONThe articles in this case and the adjacent clothing case [see 50.67.6] are some of the earliest and finest Eastern Plains pieces in existence. They were collected by Dr. Nathan Sturges Jarvis, a military surgeon stationed at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, between 1833 and 1836. Most items were made by the Eastern and Middle Dakota (Sioux) or by the peoples of the Red River region, including the Red River Métis, Anishinabe, Plains Cree, and Salteaux. Some of the objects were purchased by Jarvis, and others may have been given to him in exchange for his medical services.By the early nineteenth century, the growing numbers of white settlers and military personnel—following decades of fur trading—had depleted much of the game on which the Dakota and Red River peoples depended. Indigenous ingenuity in combining trade materials such as cloth, metal, and glass beads with traditional hides, pipestone, and porcupine and bird quills is evident in these objects.
 Ceramics have a long-standing tradition in the southwestern pueblos dating from 7500 B.C.E. to the present day. Originally all pottery production was for Native use, and specific shapes, designs, and colors can be attributed to specific pueblos. The Hopi—Pueblo people living in the southwestern United States—began making tiles for decoration in the nineteenth century. Their designs mirrored the abstracted motifs used on their pottery. By the early twentieth century, especially after the advent of the Santa Fe railroad in the 1870s, non-Native merchants and collectors passing through the region created a demand for portable Native tokens. Entrepreneurial Native potters made small bowls and decorative tiles using traditional Hopi and Pueblo designs to fulfill this commercial opportunity.
 Adolph Gottlieb was an Abstract Expressionist painter whose subjects and forms were derived from sources including African and Native American art. His series of Pictographs (1941–51) related to the beliefs and myths of these cultures, from which he created a unique visual language. Premonition of Evil, painted just after the end of World War II, depicts fragments of the human body in divided areas of the composition. Searching eyes stare out at the viewer through the windows in Gottlieb's informal grid.
 In 1942, the collector Peggy Guggenheim sought advice from the architect and designer Frederick Kiesler on how to remodel two shops on West Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan into a gallery for Surrealist and American art. Kiesler responded with plans for Art of This Century, the now-legendary gallery that became a focal point of the avant-garde. There, paintings were shown without frames, a Surrealist room incorporated curved walls, and pictures were displayed mounted on the ends of baseball bats projecting from the walls. With a nod to Surrealism’s freedoms, the gallery’s organic table could be tilted or turned upside down, becoming a pedestal to show sculpture, or an easel to display a painting, or a chair shaped to the curve of the seated figure and a companion piece to the rocking chair.
 Aaron Siskind’s photographs isolate, and render almost abstract, details of the outdoors from both natural and urban settings. His images are often considered the photographic equivalent of Abstract Expressionism, in that they look “painterly” and evoke the gestural abstraction of the New York School.
 Like all serious artists of their generation, Sloan and his friends often sketched and painted from the nude. This sketch of a woman seated on a draped studio prop is typical of Sloan’s many naturalistic depictions of the female body. Captured in a casual, unrefined pose, she appears refreshingly authentic and unidealized.
 Edward Weston gained international recognition early in his career with work from the portrait studio that he operated in California from 1911 to 1922. After meeting Alfred Stieglitz and other prominent modernists in New York in the early 1920s, he became disenchanted with the soft-focused Pictorialist style he had mastered so successfully. He returned to California to experiment with hard-edged, sharp-focused studies of nudes, organic forms, and landscapes, while his work became at the same time more abstract, often juxtaposing curvaceous forms with more geometric patterns. Weston was the first photographer ever to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, in 1937 (and again in 1938), at a time when he worked entirely outdoors with the limitless possibilities of the Western landscape. In this image from 1939, made immediately following his fellowship work, the weight and ambiguous scale of the driftwood convey a sense of monumentality. The complexity of forms and surfaces is the focus of the image, and the delicate layer of fog heightens the wood’s texture, rendering it almost palpable. The strong relationship between the drift stump and the scattered pieces of wood around it unifies the composition.
 Cameroonian masks usually carry gender associations. This is a male mask, identified by its headdress and beard. Frequently worn in ensemble performances, such masks can be seen at funeral celebrations of elders and other prominent people, as well as at annual festivals demonstrating loyalty to the fon, or king.
 Headdresses covered with leather are found only in the Cross River area of Cameroon. Some are fiercely stylized while others are startlingly realistic and may in fact have been portraits of individuals.The artist carves the form from a single piece of wood and then covers it with untanned antelope skin that has been soaked for several days, scraped, and smoothed. He stitches, pegs, and ties the skin into place and allows it to dry. Eyes, ears, scarification patterns, and hair are carved and covered separately, then pegged onto the finished piece. Finally, the piece is painted prior to performance.
 The strong three-dimensionality of the biomorphic and geometric forms in this composition makes them appear animated within a space bounded by color zones. Charles Biederman had been experimenting with progressive modern European styles since 1930 and had gravitated toward greater abstraction after seeing the work of Cubist artists such as Pablo Picasso, newly on view in New York. He painted this work while living in Paris in 1936, under the fresh influence of the Surrealists Joan Miró and Fernand Léger, who preferred strange or oddly combined forms that were both unsettling and humorous.
 
 Playfully evoking the molecular structures revealed by the electron microscope, the Hang-It-All was designed with children in mind. The colored balls, for hanging coats, hats, and scarves, seem to move around each other as one passes by. Although by no means a literal model of molecules or atoms, the Hang-It-All transforms the popular scientific imagery of the 1950s into a dynamic design.
 The unusual and otherworldly subject of a small mother-and-child group held aloft by two large disembodied hands in this drawing typifies the imagery of the artist and writer Kahlil Gibran. Like his fellow Symbolist Elihu Vedder (whose work is displayed nearby), Gibran was preoccupied with the transcendence of the soul and the universal experiences of love, spirituality, and the life cycle. The Burden alludes to themes of maternal responsibility and the role of a divine agent guiding human endeavors.
 Rather than working a watercolor rapidly, the mid-twentieth-century landscape watercolorist William Thon tended to devote numerous sessions of work to each sheet, always painting indoors, where he could best control the drying rates of washes and ink drawings. As a result, Thon’s watercolors have denser, more built-up surfaces than the modernist watercolors of the teens and twenties. Thon particularly liked the interplay of the successive layers of wash and ink and the fortuitous blurring that often occurred.
 Louise Nevelson described this sculpture as “one of the first major pieces” she created. The “personage’s” undulating frontal slab suggests a composed, outer persona, and the spiky column behind, an inner, agitated, true self. Nevelson later recalled that the work’s persona emerged in the process of creation: “While I was filing and working away at it, there was a knot where the mouth was supposed to be, just a plain knot, and I, being so concentrated, all of a sudden I saw this knot, mouth moving. And the whole thing was black by then and it frightened me.”
 Herzl Emanuel has vivid recollections about the origins of this work:Upon returning to the U.S. from four years in Paris, I found a studio on Columbia Heights in Brooklyn. It had a rear garden from which I could see the grand bridge majestically spanning the East River to the distant cluster of towering buildings of lower Manhattan. The assortment of visual elements was extremely rich . . . the astonishing structure of the bridge itself, the varied shapes and architectural styles of the soaring buildings, the river traffic, the streets paved with cobble stones, brick walls and archways, steps and streetcar tracks and overhead, banks of cumulous clouds. . . . The challenge was to organize all this seductive material into a coherent structure. My efforts at the time clearly reflected my immersion with the cubist development.
 This object creates a frightening and otherworldly effect. Gbaule are divination objects used by the We to determine the causes of illness and to identify evil forces. A diviner holds the gbaule while in a trance. He is asked questions, and the movement of the gbaule indicates a response.The divination society associated with this object was created by a man of the neighboring Krou people who had served as a soldier in France in World War I, and it became quite popular in the following decade. This origin explains why a head such as this one is also called a commandant.
 Like the Hang-It-All, The Bamboozler uses atom-derived, space-age shapes to “bamboozle” children into thinking that hanging up their clothing is fun. The designer, Richard Neagle, marketed The Bamboozler through magazine and newspaper ads that claimed: “Small fry might suppose it’s a convertible spaceship what with the revolving hat rack at the top. . . . [It] has been carefully designed so that your range rovers will find it quite a problem to knock it over.”
 To honor deceased family members, villagers kept carved wooden figures to contain the souls of their ancestors in the family house. This male figure (adu zafua) grasping two short rods wears an elaborate headdress symbolizing the tree of life.
 In this photograph, Chris Holley, winner of the twenty-seventh annual Modern Venus beauty contest, waves to the crowds from the Parachute Jump, a ride that debuted at the 1939 New York World’s Fair before being moved to Steeplechase Park in 1941. Based on a design patented by a retired Naval commander to train paratroopers, the Parachute Jump was a symbol of war that became a popular amusement ride, particularly with men who had served in World War II.
 Returning to New York in 1929 after nearly a decade in France, Berenice Abbott found a city transformed by modern life. Hired by the Works Progress Administration to document the city, she produced a large number of often dramatically composed images reflecting the city’s changing features. Abbott shot the Daily News Building looking toward the East River. Located on Forty-second Street between Third and Second avenues, the 1930 skyscraper provided a striking contrast with low-rise houses on nearby streets. It was part of a new booming business district in midtown, spurred by the completion of Grand Central Terminal in 1913. The residential Tudor City in the background had been completed in 1928, shielding what was still in the 1930s an industrial area on the East River. Although the power plant on the river exists today, the Second Avenue elevated train line was torn down in 1942.
 In a group of New York City street scenes from the 1930s, John Marin reverted to a more conventionally Cubist compositional technique better suited to the geometries of urban architecture than to rural landscapes or coastal views. In these works, drawing and watercolor are almost equally balanced: heavy outlines of planar forms, including the stylized shapes of moving figures, are enhanced by earth-toned washes that lend them relative depth.
 This highly animated figure is the work of an exceptionally gifted artist from the Wapo/Era area of the Gulf province of Papua New Guinea. Small silhouette figures of this type, called bioma, are usually placed near the floor within the men's ceremonial house in proximity to trophy skulls of pigs and crocodiles. Characteristically, bioma figures from this area are flat with two sets of limbs, one upraised, one lowered, with ridged edges along the outer sides. The extraordinary vitality of this figure is a result of its having been cut from a curved slab of wood that was probably part of an old canoe. John W. Vandercook, one of the most famous traveler-adventurers and writers of his day, likely collected the piece between 1929 and 1933.
 Japanese merchants considered the easily moveable kuruma dansu, which kept valuables and merchandise in order the storehouse, an essential possession. The chests were often included as part of a daughter's dowry. The kuruma dansu displayed here, crafted in Yamagata Prefecture, is of exceptionally high quality. The frame and door panels are zelkova wood, the finest wood used in Japanese furniture construction. The entire chest is finished in a kijiri lacquer to accentuate the wood's naturally elegant grain.
 Both men and women wore large hoop earrings as amulets to prevent evil spirits from entering the ears.
 Because of its low cost and easy care, plastic attracted both consumer and designer in the postwar era. Russel Wright worked with the chemical company American Cyanamid to develop a line of dinnerware from its patented plastic, Melamine. Although that venture was not successful, Wright soon found other companies to produce his designs for plastic dinnerware. Originally intended for institutional use, plastic dinnerware also found a place at home, and by 1957 Wright’s Residential line, produced by Northern Industrial Chemical, had door-to-door sales of $4 million.
 A self-taught artist, John Costigan preceded each of his watercolors with a series of compositional drawings on the same scale intended for the finished work. He drew the composition, once resolved, onto the final sheet (his graphite lines are readily visible here) before applying his washes in a more spontaneous manner. Throughout his mature career, Costigan found his subjects at or near the farm he owned in rural Orangeburg, New York.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 ART OF POWERAlthough art has historically glorified the powerful, it can also be a means of communication and expression for those without power. These Congolese works represent opposite ends of the social spectrum. The mwaash aMbooy mask is emblematic of royal power and prestige for the Kuba kingdom of the central Congo. It represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba trace their descent, and is worn only by the king (nyim) or by local chiefs. In both its dance and as a sculpture, it is a vision of gravity and composure. The contemporary portraits by Aimé Mpane, in turn, depict the struggles of those without access to power. They show ordinary citizens of Kinshasa, along with representations of their fears and desires. The artist carves these images from plywood, turning two-dimensional surfaces into works filled with light and shadow (suggesting both presence and absence) that animate the stories of the dispossessed.
 We rarely know the names of past African artists, but Ali Amonikoyi is an exception, largely because he was a distinctive artistic innovator. He used metalworking techniques to make objects normally carved in wood and then used these objects in a nontraditional context. Moreover, he produced his works in proximity to colonial officials who observed and recorded his personal and artistic history.Amonikoyi was a Yoruba born in Nigeria who migrated to Togo. There he used ancient brass-casting techniques to make mask forms resembling Yoruba gelede masks. These masks were placed on top of graves as memorials to the deceased, rather than being worn in dance performances.

 This necklace would have been worn by a young man along with an ensemble of other necklaces, belts, and head, arm, and leg bands as an indication of his new adult status, following circumcision. Visually setting off the head from the rest of the torso, it would have provided a background for other beaded neck ornaments.
 Blanche Lazzell made this group of objects—part of a larger suite of fourteen works—as an artistic exercise while studying in Paris with the Cubist Albert Gleizes. They provide a fascinating glimpse into Lazzell’s process of transforming a townscape into an abstract composition. The graphite drawings show her progression from a relatively representational image of an urban plaza with buildings, stairways, and trees to ever more reductive, abstract shapes that she rearranged and filled with different patterns and tones, culminating in the watercolor. This kind of experimentation allowed Lazzell to explore the expressive possibilities of abstraction, in keeping with Gleizes’s theories that the juxtaposition of flat forms—through their relation to each other and the paper surface—provides a new way to signify spatial depth.
 This is a unique work of art that bridges conventional easel painting and tile making. Original hand decoration on ceramics, termed “China painting” in the nineteenth century, was practiced both by professional artisans such as Mitchell and by amateur hobbyists. The notion of hobbies was born in the late nineteenth century as the growing prosperity of the middle class allowed for leisure activities. Handmade objects for the home were considered constructive projects to occupy housewives during their new free time.
 The gentleman photographed here is Zill al-Sultan (1850–1919), the governor of Isfahan and the brother of Muzaffar al-Din Shah. Sevruguin’s portraits often show the subjects posed as for a painting, dressed in characteristic attire. Attributes such as the elaborate, feathered helmet, hilted sword, and uniform studded with medals and the Imperial Order of the Lion and Sun underline the sitter’s military identity and high status. The photographer’s signature can be found to the right of the photograph in Cyrillic script.
 The starting point for this lively patterned abstraction was an earlier canvas by Stuart Davis entitled House and Street, 1931. Treating each subsequent version as a riff on a jazz theme, Davis moved further and further away from his original composition to establish independent, rhythmic color patterns that retained only a few direct visual cues to the original composition. Davis theorized that abstract compositions could communicate to the viewer something of the subject from which they were derived. This composition embodies the “mellow pad”—jazz lingo for the “cool” place to be. Jazz rhythms were a potent inspiration for Davis, and their presence added a distinctly American component to his abstractions.
 Pad No. 4 is one of a series of four related pictures that Stuart Davis made while working on The Mellow Pad, a painting in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection. In all of these works, the word pad appears—here, sideways in green at the upper left (and a 4 is in white at the lower right). This title reveals the artist’s fondness for wordplay: pad refers both to an artist’s sketchbook and to the jazz slang term for “home.” A lifelong aficionado of jazz, Davis regularly drew analogies between the visual patterns of his pictures and the syncopated rhythms of this modern form of American music.
 Visually, this whimsical salt and pepper set bridges the gap between a sculpture by Hans Arp and Al Capp’s curious cartoon “shmoo” characters, reflecting the delight with soft, curving forms in art from high to low. Just as important from a design point of view, however, is the relationship of these objects to the hand that holds them, and their function as shakers. The lower body of the shaker fits snugly in the palm of the hand, the forefinger wraps around the neck, and seasonings are cast effortlessly from the head.
 Designers such as Eva Zeisel created objects with softly curving forms based on nature. Postwar manufacturers such as Red Wing, interested in good modern design, were able to bring these forms to the style-conscious American consumer at a reasonable price.
 Mara McAfee infuses her work with playful puns and witty commentary. Her art places familiar images from comic books, like the sleekly masculine figures of Marvelous Modern Mechanical Men, into a more traditionally high-art landscape. Combining popular imagery with a painterly execution—an aesthetic choice different from the intentionally flat coloring of many other Pop artists—allows McAfee to challenge the boundary between high and low from a different angle. Many of her pieces (such as You Can’t Catch Me, shown here) are almost cinematic in composition, creating a narrative structure that aids her humorous intentions.
 The magazine Good Furniture commented in 1927 that Paul T. Frankl “has developed one feature that is absolutely unique. This is the now somewhat celebrated skyscraper type of furniture, which is as American and as New Yorkish as Fifth Avenue itself.” Indeed, what could be more American and modern than furniture based on this unique contribution to architecture—the skyscraper. Frankl, who was creating furniture of this type by 1925, was one of the first modern designers of American decorative arts.
Serpentine curves inspired by natural forms were a mainstay of O’Keeffe’s art from the earliest years of her career. Later on, she found new pictorial opportunities in the aerial view, which she discovered when she flew across the country and around the world in the lower-altitude propeller planes of the 1950s and 1960s. In this work, which suggests the ribbon-like meander of a Western river through arid terrain, her reference to place is almost entirely subsumed by the force of the calligraphic, abstract design.
 The Pedernal is a flat-topped mountain that commands the Ghost Ranch landscape and is visible for miles in every direction. O’Keeffe was inspired by its unusual topography and regal presence. It became for her what Mount Fuji was for Hokusai or Mont Sainte-Victoire for Paul Cézanne—a compelling natural feature to be explored again and again in different compositions. Late in life, she liked to tell interviewers that she thought if she painted the Pedernal often enough, God would give it to her.

 Tiffany iridescence was imitated by other manufacturers. The most successful of these was Frederick Carder, whose “Aurene” glass rivaled the beauty of Tiffany’s “Favrile” line.
 From the outset, Coney Island’s amusements offered middle-class New Yorkers the freedom to spend their hard-won moments of leisure in an atmosphere of unfettered frivolity. Various rides offered the sexes an unusual degree of unmonitored contact that would have scandalized proper Victorians. In this vivid Depression-era painting of one of the wild “bowls,” in which friends and strangers alike were thrown into contact by the overpowering centrifugal force, the figure painter Reginald Marsh described the chaotic tangle of their bodies with the sensual physicality for which his work was best known.
 Every Northwest Coast family had a supply of spoons. Those for common household purposes were of the same shape and materials as feast spoons, though undecorated. Feast spoons such as this example were brought out, in the same way as fine china or best silverware in other cultures, when a family gave a celebratory feast or when visitors arrived from another village. The number of feast spoons was determined by the magnificence of the feast the family could afford. This Haida spoon was delicately carved from a single piece of goat horn and decorated with five animal heads, each with abalone-shell eyes. Before carving, the horn was steamed until pliable, bent into shape, and cooled in a mold.
 This woven storage basket echoes the shape of a Pueblo water jar. Smaller versions of this form would have been lined with pitch and used, with a lid, to hold water, wild grass seeds, or domesticated corn and beans. By the late nineteenth century, the shape was enlarged for the thriving art market. Exact meanings of each design have been lost, but figures depicted with horns, as seen here, usually refer to power coming from or going to the sky. The woven, interlocking forms of light and dark suggest the Apache belief of complete harmony with all elements of the universe.Esta cesta de almacenaje tejida hace eco de la forma de las ollas de agua Pueblo. Versiones más pequeñas de esta forma pueden haberse recubierto con alquitrán y usado, con una tapa, para contener agua, semillas de pasto salvaje, o maíz y frijoles domesticados. Hacia finales del siglo diecinueve, la forma se agrandó para acomodar el floreciente mercado artístico. El significado exacto de cada diseño se ha perdido, pero figuras representadas con cuernos como las que se ven aquí, usualmente significan poder que proviene o va hacia el cielo. Las formas tejidas interconectadas claras y oscuras sugieren la creencia Apache de completa armonía con todos los elementos del universo.
 With its imaginative arrangement of an infant, a cow pull toy, and other objects of personal significance, this drawing constitutes a symbolic portrait of the artist, who developed an idiosyncratic style combining Eastern and Western influences. Here the tipped-up perspective and asymmetrical composition suggest a Japanese aesthetic, while the figural distortions are indebted to American and European modernism. In the early 1920s, before turning to painting, Yasuo Kuniyoshi embraced the traditional Eastern practice of ink drawing, yet he manipulated the medium in unconventional ways, creating a range of textures and tones through the varied application of broad washes and delicate lines.
 In the early 1900s this Northwest Coast potlatch figure would have been called "primitive" art, as if it were a simpler version of European-derived art. However, the Native American artist who carved this figure was following the formal artistic traditions of Kwakwaka'wakw society. Potlatch figures were place outside a chief's large house during a potlatch to emphasize his power. At a potlatch, a celebration held for occasions such as births, deaths, marriages, and treaty signings, the chief gave away much of his valuable belongings to the attendees, affirming his wealth and power and obligating the recipients to reciprocate at some future time.
 Study of Two Dancers represents a later phase in the artist’s work, in which highly simplified outlines have replaced heavily worked forms and densely built-up surfaces. During the teens Davies was almost completely absorbed with the theme of dancers in movement, creating endless variations such as this one.

 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design  is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not  always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came  somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the  ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy  in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there  were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti,  an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his  native country through two architecture and design magazines he  founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in  the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture,  unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected  modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not,  however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy  expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware  of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues  between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art  Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development  Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution  in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by  more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture,  ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing,  and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn  Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed   among the host institutions, the lion’s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a  center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study  and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

 This lithograph is one of ten scenery and costume designs by El Lissitzky for a puppet version of the 1913 Russian Futurist opera Victory over the Sun, a tale of the clash between technological progress and social order set in a utopian universe. In his interpretation of the opera, Lissitzky emphasized its power imbalances through severely abstracted sets and costumes. His new generation’s politicized avant-garde style, Constructivism, enlisted abstract art as a catalyst not just for spiritual experience but also for social change.
 Josef Albers had a lifelong interest in color’s meditative qualities. With the help of simple color combinations, he aimed to show that flat shapes on a two-dimensional surface can create an illusion of movement and depth. Albers believed that the introduction of a white line into one of the color fields affected the perception of the color on both sides of the line. He felt that experimentation with subtle colors—as in these two works—proved the power of the line and the efficacy of his theory.
 Marion Anderson Noyes was one of the few American women of the twentieth century to have a long and active career as a professional metalsmith. Beginning in the late 1930s, she designed both modernist flatware and hollowware for major firms including Reed & Barton and Towle. She also occasionally fashioned handmade jewelry such as the three closely related brooches seen here. The simple stylized interpretation of nature reflects earlier twentieth-century jewelry design, especially from Vienna.

 The Tetela and the Songye are closely related groups who make figures for personal religious rituals. Carving styles and materials for these figures are as diverse as their individual functions. A figure may be used to cure illness, bring wealth, or ensure good hunting. This figure includes fur wrapped tightly around its body and a horn from an antelope projecting from its head.
 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.
 The Luba believe that twins, called "children of the moon," have supernatural powers and can be the harbingers of both good and evil. Twins must be honored and appeased through songs, prayers, blessings, and gifts made each month on the night of a new moon. Figures like this commemorate the spirit of a twin, and the insertion of an iron pin in the top of the head is intended to contain and channel the spirit within.
 Ivory’s value results from its scarcity, as well as its association with the elephant, a symbol of power and strength. Ivory bracelets, decorated with engraved designs, were made by the Fur of the Darfur region of Sudan and traded as far as Eritrea and the Republic of the Congo. Hairpins from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are worn by both men and women to hold hats and ornate hairstyles in place. These hairpins are particularly ostentatious, since each is made from a large piece of ivory, most of which is carved away.
 Kwahu, or Eagle Dancer, usually appears in a troupe of several dancers, spreading feathered wings and squawking and imitating eagle behavior while the Koyemshi (Mudhead Kachinas) sing to him. The sponsoring kiva—a men’s society that holds its meetings in sacred underground spaces—must fast and abstain from sexual relations for a period before the dance. The Eagle Dance is a prayer for good crops, rain, and plentiful eagle feathers. Because the eagle is considered sacred, its feathers are important in many ceremonies. Kwahu, o Bailarín Aguila, usualmente aparece con una tropa de varios danzantes, extendiendo sus alas emplumadas y graznando e imitando la conducta de las águilas mientras los Koyemshi (Kachinas Cabeza de Barro) le cantan. La kiva auspiciadora – sociedad masculina que se reúne en espacios sagrados subterráneos—debe ayunar y abstenerse de relaciones sexuales por un cierto periodo antes de la danza. La Danza Aguila es una plegaria para recibir buenas cosechas, lluvia y abundancia de plumas de águila. Al ser el águila considerada sagrada, sus plumas son importantes en muchas ceremonias.
 Sidney Kerner joined the Photo League, a cooperative of New York photographers committed to socially conscious images, in 1937, when he was just seventeen years old. The following year, he captured the harsh realities of life during the Great Depression in this image taken at Coney Island. The economic hardship reflected in the girl’s tattered and ill-fitting clothing is paralleled by the run-down nature of her surroundings.
 In Ghana and the Ivory Coast, regions that acquired great wealth from the mining and trading of gold, rulers displayed their status by wearing a profusion of gold ornaments, even attaching such objects to umbrellas and swords. Although many of these ornaments are abstract geometric shapes, some represent human faces or animals. Such works were made using the lost-wax casting method, in which a clay mold was made around a modeled wax form. The mold was then heated and the wax poured out, after which molten gold was poured in and solidified in the form of the original wax model.
 ART OF INNOVATIONThese three works speak to the highly inventive history of Yoruba art. Incorporating outside materials, they each reflect how both a colonial past and global exchange shaped shifting ideas about local identity. Even this bead-embroidered crown, the ultimate symbol of Yoruba kingship, is the product of a complex global story. Although the Yoruba have a long history of glassmaking, the large, multicolored ade crown depicts figures wearing bowler hats and contains beads imported by the British in the late nineteenth century into what would soon become the Nigeria colony. The smaller beaded crown, known as an oríkògbòfó, is an evolution of the ade form, but it is modeled after the wig of a British barrister (lawyer), still worn in court today by members of the Nigerian judiciary. Yinka Shonibare, a British artist of Yoruba and Nigerian descent, used Dutch wax-printed fabric to create Skipping Girl. This material—a commodity associated with Africa but actually created in Europe, based on Indonesian designs, and sold in West Africa—serves as a symbol of the web of economic and cultural interrelationships among Africa, Asia, and Europe. Shonibare exposes cultural "authenticity" as an illusion and evokes the layers of historical connections among global cultures.
 A Sufi’s attributes and clothing indicate the mystical order to which he or she belongs and may also suggest rank and status within that order. Here, the patriarch’s black robe emphasizes his authority. The varied styles of the hats further delineate positions within the group. The central seated figure holds a tabar, a small ceremonial axe, while each of the remaining men holds a walking staff, another iconic Sufi attribute. The extremely long beards of the male members identify this group as part of the Ahl-i Haqq order of Sufis, whose practices are guarded with extreme secrecy. The portrait may have been taken by Antoin Sevruguin, who served at the court of the Qajar ruler Nasir al-Din Shah in the latter nineteenth century and is known for his photographs of Iranian landscapes and subjects.
 
 Just before moving to New Mexico permanently in 1949, O’Keeffe painted this farewell salute to New York, her home for thirty years. The Brooklyn Bridge was an iconic subject for her generation of modern artists, but she had never painted it before. She used the twin arches and harp-like cables of the bridge to create a valentine to the things she was leaving behind, saying goodbye to Stieglitz, their partnership, and the city where they launched their careers. The bridge is also a gateway, perhaps her metaphor for leaving the manmade city of stone and steel for the clear blue skies of New Mexico.
 In 1916 and 1917 Matisse devoted several small paintings to an Italian model named Laurette, whom he consistently posed in a pink armchair and green robe. This example is a study in sinuous curves—from the model’s long, dark hair to the black contours describing the fall of her robe to the wood frame of the chair. Although Laurette looks out of the picture plane in the direction of the viewer, her expression seems distant, unfocused, and meditative. Matisse has incised his signature in the upper right corner of the work, most likely using the handle of his brush.
