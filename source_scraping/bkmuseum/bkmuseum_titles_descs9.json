Part of an artistic movement that began in the early 1970s with the Pintupi clan, of which he is a member, Tjungurrayi adopted the format of painting on canvas to depict what might be considered a cosmological landscape that encompasses the past, present, and future. The serpents relate to ancestors who created the waterholes, indicated by concentric circles, at a specific desert, with the background patterns representing its sand hills. These symbols are drawn from centuries-old cultural traditions of Australian indigenous peoples\u2014including stories of creation, legends of ancestors, and daily customs\u2014that are passed down orally or through ephemeral sand paintings.",

Incorporating outside materials, they each reflect how both a colonial past and global exchange shaped shifting ideas about local identity. \n\r\nEven this bead-embroidered crown, the ultimate symbol of Yoruba kingship, is the product of a complex global story. Although the Yoruba have a long history of glassmaking, the large, multicolored ade crown depicts figures wearing bowler hats and contains beads imported by the British in the late nineteenth century into what would soon become the Nigeria colony. The smaller beaded crown, known as an or\u00edk\u00f2gb\u00f2f\u00f3, is an evolution of the ade form, but it is modeled after the wig of a British barrister (lawyer), still worn in court today by members of the Nigerian judiciary. \n\r\nYinka Shonibare, a British artist of Yoruba and Nigerian descent, used Dutch wax-printed fabric to create Skipping Girl. This material\u2014a commodity associated with Africa but actually created in Europe, based on Indonesian designs, and sold in West Africa\u2014serves as a symbol of the web of economic and cultural interrelationships among Africa, Asia, and Europe. Shonibare exposes cultural \"authenticity\" as an illusion and evokes the layers of historical connections among global cultures.",

Searching online databases for his father\u2019s prison record, he found dozens listed who shared his father\u2019s first name, Jerome, as well as his surname. Struck by this discovery, he created ten-inch portraits of each Jerome, based on their mug shots. The diptych on view here shows Kaphar\u2019s own father, at a much larger scale than in previous works in the series. \n\r\nDepicting African American men, who are greatly overrepresented in the prison system, the portraits are simultaneously individual and collective. The panels were painted on flat gold-leaf backgrounds and partially submerged in tar. Initially, the level of the tar reflected the percentage of each lifetime spent in prison, but Kaphar abandoned this formula in acknowledgment of incarceration\u2019s lingering aftereffects, such as difficulty securing employment and loss of voting rights. The portraits draw on the visual tradition of Byzantine icons, specifically depictions of Saint Jerome, patron saint of students, librarians, and scholars.",

In the years during and after World War II, riders were hoisted to the top of the tower in a canvas seat attached to a closed parachute. When they were dropped from the top, only the parachute would slow the descent. Like the Wonder Wheel, the Cyclone, and Childs Restaurant, the tower is now protected by its landmark status and will remain at Coney Island even after the redevelopment of the area. Like several other steel structures that made their way to Coney Island, the Parachute Jump originated as a ride at a world\u2019s fair (in this case, the 1939 New York World\u2019s Fair), reflecting the often-utopian nature of the ventures that developed Coney Island over its history.",

New and more affordable lightweight cameras allowed photographers to be freer in the exploration of their topic. Brooklyn-born Stephen Salmieri had just graduated from School of Visual Arts in New York when he started his Coney Island series in 1966. Working in the tradition of many mid-twentieth-century independent photographers (such as Robert Frank and Lisette Model) who found Coney Island an inspiring subject, Salmieri spent the following six years documenting a decaying area, still full of life. Last summer there was still a limited stretch of concession stands on the Bowery, not much different from the ones in Salmieri\u2019s suite of images. Even though some barkers are now relying on electronic amplification to lure passersby to their games, the original intention remains the same.",

Cancellation of a series (by marking the plates with an X) ensures that no unauthorized copies of an artist\u2019s work are executed. For Untitled (Cancellation Prints), Ligon himself cancelled the plates by drawing large drypoint Xs on them but then authorized an edition from them. The artist stated, \u201cCancelled but present, new but haunted by the ghosts of their earlier meanings, the prints speak to the mutability of questions of racial identity and a shift in the cultural context in which the original works were received.\u201d",

He created narratives in a cartoon-like style, returning repeatedly to certain motifs, all evident here: the solitary light bulb, severed arms and legs, horseshoes, and the soles of hobnailed boots. Brushed in broad strokes and a vivid red palette, the objects set against a curtain in an interior space allude to tragic events, both personal and in the wider world.",

            "description": "With a kaleidoscopic array of brilliant colors and bold geometric patterns, Romare Bearden evoked the mystery and vitality of African spiritual traditions in Wizard\u2019s Domaine. Although there is no clear narrative, the white-robed figure at right seems to be entreating the winged character of the wizard, gazing down on his domain from the sky. The remainder of the composition is densely packed with the forms of a building, other figures and animals, and plants, as well as abstract symbols and decorative passages.\n\r\nThroughout his career, Bearden was particularly interested in the African American experience, but he also believed that a universal \u201cprevalence of ritual\u201d united people across generations and cultures. He drew stylistic inspiration from a variety of sources, including African art, Cubist and Dadaist collage, jazz music, and Caribbean landscapes.\n\r\nThis work has been placed on view as part of Romare Bearden: 20th Century American Master, a centennial tribute organized by the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Romare Bearden Foundation. Events and installations nationwide mark the hundredth anniversary of Bearden\u2019s birth. For more information, visit beardencentennial.org. To find out where to view other Bearden artworks in the tristate area between now and September 2012, visit studiomuseum.org.\n\r\nBorn in North Carolina, Bearden moved to Harlem with his family in 1920. He produced his earliest work as a cartoonist for school publications at Boston University and New York University. While at NYU, he took art classes at the Art Students League. Following his service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Bearden studied philosophy in Paris, where he came into contact with modernist artists. Back in New York, he supported himself as a songwriter and a social worker in the early 1950s and then resumed his work as an artist in the 1960s. He was a founding member of Spiral, a collective of African American artists formed in 1963 to explore their role in American art and society. During this period, Bearden began making the widely acclaimed collages that became the hallmark of his oeuvre.",
