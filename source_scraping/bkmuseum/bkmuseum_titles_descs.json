It brings together photographs from various traditions\u2014including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary\u2014as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story\u2014sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.",

The potential for transformation that occurs with this material is echoed here by themes of migration and social change suggested by the covered wagon, part of the collective memory and mythology of American culture.",
