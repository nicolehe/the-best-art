In making a stool whose luxury and beauty surpassed its usefulness, Legrain looked back to older ways of thinking. His use of an African model, however, was new and reflected a growing fascination with the arts of Africa among sophisticated Europeans in the 1920s.\n\r\nBy turning a traditionally simple African form into a luxury object made of lacquered wood and covered with expensive sharkskin, Legrain reflected the cultural imperialism of his time, when Western artists and designers raided the artistic heritage of the world and remade objects from other cultures to accommodate consumers\u2019 taste.",

However, circumstances sometimes require the invention of totally new types of masquerade to address new issues.\n\r\nOde-lay is a uniquely urban form of masquerade that developed in Sierra Leone\u2019s capital city of Freetown. This mask likely has its origins in the 1960s or \u201870s, when new genres of film, particularly those from or about Asia, inspired novel mask creations. The crowned central figure on this mask, flanked by two pairs of sinuous snarling serpents, may be directly related to the kung fu movies of the period. The imagery of this mask may also recall that of Mami Wata, a pan-African water goddess recognized throughout West Africa and the Caribbean, whose roots lie in the local adaptation of imagery drawing from India, the Pacific, and Europe.\n\r\nMale Yoruba dancers wear gelede masks at festivals honoring the women of the community. Gelede often serves as a showcase for artistic innovation, with its masks depicting motifs that are both entertaining and critical. The full-body example seen here is a highly unusual artistic reinvention of the gelede form; only about half a dozen are known in Western collections.",

Starting with the rigorous geometry of nested squares, Albers created these works by applying paint directly from the tube and spreading it onto the Masonite board with a palette knife. The juxtaposed slabs of color play off one another, as some squares seem to recede into space while others float into the foreground. Albers pursued this study of color and perception from 1950 until his death, producing nearly a thousand canvases in the series.",

Together they viewed the famous Chinese painting of six persimmons (kaki) by the Song artist Mu Ch'i (active thirteenth century), which was on view in an exhibition of treasures in a Japanese museum.Arakawa went back to his studio and fashioned this small incense box in the form of the fruit, firing it with the simple but effective decoration technique known as nezumi-Shino (gray Shino). He then gave it to Mrs. Conant as a memento of their experience.",

Made out of the same expensive materials as the original Phyfe chair, it is an example of the Colonial Revival style that began about the time of the United States centennial in 1876 and continued well into the twentieth century. Out of a desire to define themselves and their place in the world, Americans began to look back proudly to their past. They then began to build colonial-style houses and fill them with early American\u2013style furniture such as this chair.",

The drama of McEntee\u2019s painting, with its imposing boulder and foreboding clouds, is echoed in Marsden Hartley\u2019s seascape. A Maine native, Hartley used an expressionist style of rough brushstrokes, bold outlines, and compressed space to depict the churning sea crashing against the rocky shore.",

Reflecting on this time, Rothko later said: \"It was with utmost reluctance that I found that the figure could not serve my purposes \u2026 but a time came when none of us could use the figure without mutilating it.\" Rothko's work of the mid-1940s is an amalgam of Surrealism and abstraction. Vessels of Magic anticipates these works with horizontal registers on the paper's surface broken only by passages of imagery and gesture. The vessel forms may suggest the artist's interest in classical mythology, while the image's watery quality has a primordial, mythic nature that suggests something of humankind's origins as well as the power of magic.",

She eventually became world-famous, attracting visits from Japanese masters who wanted to learn her techniques. John D.

They were collected by Dr. Nathan Sturges Jarvis, a military surgeon stationed at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, between 1833 and 1836. Most items were made by the Eastern and Middle Dakota (Sioux) or by the peoples of the Red River region, including the Red River M\u00e9tis, Anishinabe, Plains Cree, and Salteaux. Some of the objects were purchased by Jarvis, and others may have been given to him in exchange for his medical services.\n\r\nBy the early nineteenth century, the growing numbers of white settlers and military personnel\u2014following decades of fur trading\u2014had depleted much of the game on which the Dakota and Red River peoples depended.

The Hopi\u2014Pueblo people living in the southwestern United States\u2014began making tiles for decoration in the nineteenth century. Their designs mirrored the abstracted motifs used on their pottery. By the early twentieth century, especially after the advent of the Santa Fe railroad in the 1870s, non-Native merchants and collectors passing through the region created a demand for portable Native tokens. Entrepreneurial Native potters made small bowls and decorative tiles using traditional Hopi and Pueblo designs to fulfill this commercial opportunity.",

There, paintings were shown without frames, a Surrealist room incorporated curved walls, and pictures were displayed mounted on the ends of baseball bats projecting from the walls. With a nod to Surrealism\u2019s freedoms, the gallery\u2019s organic table could be tilted or turned upside down, becoming a pedestal to show sculpture, or an easel to display a painting, or a chair shaped to the curve of the seated figure and a companion piece to the rocking chair.",

After meeting Alfred Stieglitz and other prominent modernists in New York in the early 1920s, he became disenchanted with the soft-focused Pictorialist style he had mastered so successfully. He returned to California to experiment with hard-edged, sharp-focused studies of nudes, organic forms, and landscapes, while his work became at the same time more abstract, often juxtaposing curvaceous forms with more geometric patterns. Weston was the first photographer ever to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, in 1937 (and again in 1938), at a time when he worked entirely outdoors with the limitless possibilities of the Western landscape. \n\r\nIn this image from 1939, made immediately following his fellowship work, the weight and ambiguous scale of the driftwood convey a sense of monumentality. The complexity of forms and surfaces is the focus of the image, and the delicate layer of fog heightens the wood\u2019s texture, rendering it almost palpable. The strong relationship between the drift stump and the scattered pieces of wood around it unifies the composition.",

The Burden alludes to themes of maternal responsibility and the role of a divine agent guiding human endeavors.",

Nevelson later recalled that the work\u2019s persona emerged in the process of creation: \u201cWhile I was filing and working away at it, there was a knot where the mouth was supposed to be, just a plain knot, and I, being so concentrated, all of a sudden I saw this knot, mouth moving.

It had a rear garden from which I could see the grand bridge majestically spanning the East River to the distant cluster of towering buildings of lower Manhattan. The assortment of visual elements was extremely rich . . . the astonishing structure of the bridge itself, the varied shapes and architectural styles of the soaring buildings, the river traffic, the streets paved with cobble stones, brick walls and archways, steps and streetcar tracks and overhead, banks of cumulous clouds. . . . The challenge was to organize all this seductive material into a coherent structure. My efforts at the time clearly reflected my immersion with the cubist development.",

Hired by the Works Progress Administration to document the city, she produced a large number of often dramatically composed images reflecting the city\u2019s changing features. Abbott shot the Daily News Building looking toward the East River. Located on Forty-second Street between Third and Second avenues, the 1930 skyscraper provided a striking contrast with low-rise houses on nearby streets. It was part of a new booming business district in midtown, spurred by the completion of Grand Central Terminal in 1913. The residential Tudor City in the background had been completed in 1928, shielding what was still in the 1930s an industrial area on the East River. Although the power plant on the river exists today, the Second Avenue elevated train line was torn down in 1942.",

Small silhouette figures of this type, called bioma, are usually placed near the floor within the men's ceremonial house in proximity to trophy skulls of pigs and crocodiles. Characteristically, bioma figures from this area are flat with two sets of limbs, one upraised, one lowered, with ridged edges along the outer sides. The extraordinary vitality of this figure is a result of its having been cut from a curved slab of wood that was probably part of an old canoe. John W. Vandercook, one of the most famous traveler-adventurers and writers of his day, likely collected the piece between 1929 and 1933.",

These Congolese works represent opposite ends of the social spectrum. \n\r\nThe mwaash aMbooy mask is emblematic of royal power and prestige for the Kuba kingdom of the central Congo. It represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba trace their descent, and is worn only by the king (nyim) or by local chiefs. In both its dance and as a sculpture, it is a vision of gravity and composure. \n\r\nThe contemporary portraits by Aim\u00e9 Mpane, in turn, depict the struggles of those without access to power. They show ordinary citizens of Kinshasa, along with representations of their fears and desires. The artist carves these images from plywood, turning two-dimensional surfaces into works filled with light and shadow (suggesting both presence and absence) that animate the stories of the dispossessed.",

They provide a fascinating glimpse into Lazzell\u2019s process of transforming a townscape into an abstract composition. The graphite drawings show her progression from a relatively representational image of an urban plaza with buildings, stairways, and trees to ever more reductive, abstract shapes that she rearranged and filled with different patterns and tones, culminating in the watercolor. This kind of experimentation allowed Lazzell to explore the expressive possibilities of abstraction, in keeping with Gleizes\u2019s theories that the juxtaposition of flat forms\u2014through their relation to each other and the paper surface\u2014provides a new way to signify spatial depth.",

Treating each subsequent version as a riff on a jazz theme, Davis moved further and further away from his original composition to establish independent, rhythmic color patterns that retained only a few direct visual cues to the original composition. Davis theorized that abstract compositions could communicate to the viewer something of the subject from which they were derived. This composition embodies the \u201cmellow pad\u201d\u2014jazz lingo for the \u201ccool\u201d place to be. Jazz rhythms were a potent inspiration for Davis, and their presence added a distinctly American component to his abstractions.",
