This selection of works focuses on family, domestic space, and the urban landscape. It brings together photographs from various traditions—including Conceptualism, still life, and social documentary—as well as a piece by a male quilter. Although they represent several generations of artists, often with differing creative practices and intents, these works each tell a story—sometimes obvious, sometimes implicit. Frequently they picture the home, especially the bedroom, encouraging us to contemplate the personal and private moments that make up a life. Shown together, these works ask us to think critically about the role played by the artist, particularly the photographer, in the creation and shaping of a narrative.

 Jean-Michel Othoniel has transformed this utilitarian vehicle—a nineteenth-century covered wagon known as a prairie schooner—into an elegant object of beauty by remaking its canvas cover with panes of blown glass and adding swags and finials composed of oversized glass beads.
The artist, who favors alterable materials, began working with sulfur and wax and since 1993 has also experimented with the possibilities presented by glass. The potential for transformation that occurs with this material is echoed here by themes of migration and social change suggested by the covered wagon, part of the collective memory and mythology of American culture.

 Sol LeWitt was a mentor to many younger artists and writers. He was so significant to Lippard’s thinking that she dedicated Six Years to him. While his own practice always led to materialized works, he defined his artistic method as Conceptual, because he would always start from an idea, often permutations of a basic form or repetition of an operation, which he called the “machine that makes the art.” These two sketches show him elaborating the multiple forms of open cubes, and some of the various configurations possible for parallel straight lines.

 Though Kehinde Wiley is best known for his painted portraits, here he shifts from painting to sculpture. In both the lift and turn of the young man’s head and the open V of his zippered collar, this bronze refers to an eighteenth-century marble bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon (see illustration).
Yet in many other ways, Wiley’s work could hardly be more different: in substituting male for female, black for white, and present for past, he upends the earlier sculpture even as he quotes it. His radical reinterpretation encourages us to examine the stereotypes that can be found in portraiture.

 Ellen Lesperance creates knitting patterns based on examples of sweaters she finds in archival photographs of female activists, and then uses these pattern paintings as guides for her hand-knit “historic” sweaters. The neatly lettered title on this painting links it to direct action and political resistance, tracing the radical history of women imprisoned for spearheading antinuclear encampments in the 1980s. Displayed together, Lesperance’s painting and sweater engage this activist history, literally and metaphorically offering a pattern for a new generation.

 Judy Chicago created this test plate for her room-size installation The Dinner Party (on permanent view on the fourth floor of the Museum), a milestone in twentieth-century art. The installation is composed of a banquet arranged on a triangular table with thirty-nine place settings, each commemorating an important woman from history.
Dedicated to the black abolitionist and feminist Sojourner Truth (1797–1883), this plate depicts weeping for the suffering of the slaves, a mask concealing the real self, and a fist raised in rage and defiance.

 Geometric and spare, Clay Ketter’s R.T.P.18.B is part of his Renovation Trace Paintings series, initiated in 1995. Constructed out of common building materials including wallboard, paint, and joint compound, this large panel resembles an actual section of a wall with a doorway flanked by cupboards. 
The image is enigmatic, in a number of ways: The wall could be in the process of either construction or demolition, the place either real or imaginary. Moreover, the muted tones and streamlined aesthetic recall both Bauhaus design and Minimalist sculpture. And, as both object and image, R.T.P.18.B straddles the categories of sculpture and painting. Whatever the object’s significance, the artist’s experience as a carpenter informs the subject and materials of his work.

 Anna Williams, an African American quilt-maker born and raised near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, made quilts throughout her life, incorporating scraps of traditional printed cottons, unusual synthetics, and woven or decorated fabrics such as the sequined pieces seen here. The artist’s bold approach combines traditional block settings with free-flowing improvisation and a masterful use of color. In the late 1980s, Williams’s unique style of quilt-making was recognized by artists and collectors, who encouraged her to exhibit and sell her work.

 Through the Large Glass documents one of Wilke’s most effective and well-known performances, in which she executed a languid striptease behind the cracked transparent surface of Marcel Duchamp’s famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass), 1915–23, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1976. Dressed in a fedora and a man’s white satin suit, she strikes a series of poses evoking the style of 1970s fashion photography and then strips, cleverly suggesting bride and bachelor simultaneously. In her self-conscious affectation of a fashion model, Wilke willfully uses her own image and her sexuality to confront the erotic representation of women in art history and popular culture.

 

 Nayland Blake is known for work that emphasizes issues of race and sexuality. He explores the complexity of racial and sexual identity and social prejudice, using the image of the rabbit to refer to not only gay sexuality and African American heritage but individual freedom from society’s classifications. In 2000 he stated, “I’m using the rabbit as this metaphor for something that’s sort of in-between race. Of indeterminate race. That came from thinking about Br’er Rabbit. . . . Those stories are West African folktales that came into this country with slaves. They’re like the progenitor of Bugs Bunny. So in thinking about my own racial identity, I kept sort of using this rabbit metaphor.”

 In the Quechua-speaking community of Chinchero, men and women wear distinctive garments that identify them by gender and community. Large garments such as this shawl are woven in two parts—symmetrical opposites that are sewn together. Wide blue bands called pampakuna, or fields, are set apart by multi-striped panels filled with colorful geometric designs. Shawls with indigo-blue fields are characteristic of Chinchero women's garments.

 Petah Coyne’s fantastical forms, presenting a beauty that slides into the grotesque, allude to death and decay. Her large, arresting sculptures are neither abstraction nor figuration, but exist somewhere be- tween the two. Using a wide range of nontraditional materials including hay, wire, black sand, specially formulated wax, silk flowers, ribbons, artificial birds, earth, hair, and trees, Coyne often veils or covers objects as though they were artifacts frozen in time. Often hanging from the ceiling, her sculpturesproject a sense of unease and fragility. Although the materials appear delicate, one senses the weight and density of the works—the gossamer-like Untitled 816 (Dr. Zhivago), for example, weighs three hundred pounds.
Coyne is part of a generation of feminist sculptors who came of age in the late 1980s after Minimalism. Like many of her contemopraries such as Ursula von Rydingsvard, she seeks to integrate themes of nature and the self in her works.

 This work was inspired by Mickalene Thomas’s 2011 residency at the house and gardens of the French Impressionist painter Claude Monet (1840–1926) in Giverny, France (see illustration). Thomas responded strongly to the colors Monet selected for the rooms of his house, the collection of art that hung on the walls, and the views of the garden that were deliberately framed by the windows. The Giverny residency coincided with her adoption of interiors and landscape as motifs in her own work.

 As suggested by her assumed name, the artist known as Swoon is an admirer of urban art like that featured in the special exhibition Graffiti, on view elsewhere on this floor. Trained in printmaking in Prague and at Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute, she decided to take her own art to the streets in l999, pasting her large linoleum- and woodcuts, printed on thin paper, on the sides of the industrial buildings of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side.
The artist’s main subjects are the people of the city, often her family members and friends but also strangers. “I go and look at people hanging out on the street,” she says. “So what I wind up with is actually a street scene—a portrait of the city.”
Recently, Swoon has begun creating large, intricate installations in which layers of printed and cutout material projecting into space are supplemented by objects found in the street. Brooklyn Museum Installation is a site-specific work based on a 2003 piece called Coney Island Cyclone, after the landmark Brooklyn roller coaster. The artist translates the coaster’s image into an intricate web of printed fragments. The lacelike appearance reveals influences as various as Indonesian shadow puppets and the printing methods of German Expressionism.
The artist’s attraction to Coney Island derives from an all-American fascination with this place of wonder, magic, and bizarre personages. For Swoon, who was born in Florida, Coney Island encapsulates New York and its never-ending surprises, possibilities, and mystery.

 This tapered water jar with a highly polished black surface has a bear-paw motif on its neck. Alluding to the Santa Clara legend of a bear that led people to water in a time of drought, the bear paw is placed upright, as if in prayer asking for rain and everlasting life. The bands around the jar, referred to as rainbows, are also considered prayers, to keep the water from evaporating. According to Margaret Tafoya, the bear paw and rainbow designs are gifts from her Santa Clara ancestors. 

Esta jarra alargada de superficie negra bruñida tiene un motivo de garra de oso en el cuello. Aludiendo a la leyenda Santa Clara en la cual un oso condujo a la gente al agua en tiempo de sequía, la garra de oso está colocada hacia arriba, como en una plegaria pidiendo lluvia y vida eterna. Las franjas alrededor de la jarra, semejando un arcoíris, también se consideran plegarias, para prevenir que se evapore el agua. De acuerdo con Margaret Tafoya, los diseños de garra de oso y el arcoíris son regalos de sus ancestros Santa Clara.

 Yoram Wolberger’s sculpture of a Native American warrior belongs to a series of monumental versions of the plastic toy figurines that the artist used to stage elaborate mock battles between cowboys and Indians during his youth. Though infused with nostalgia, Red Indian #4 also invokes the violence that permeates both popular childhood games and the history of indigenous peoples in North America. 
To create his sculpture, Wolberger took molds of toy figurines—objects that were themselves based on stock images of Native Americans in nineteenth-century landscape paintings of America’s wilderness. Such imagery helped to foster perceptions among non-Natives of Indians as uncivilized, hostile, and an impediment to national progress defined by westward expansion. 
The irregular “fins” around the edges of Wolberger’s sculpture, which mimic the seams of their mass-produced toy counterparts, symbolize the continuing proliferation of standardized images of Native Americans and the American frontier. Moreover, the lack of detail and the generic character of his warrior underscore the ways in which stereotypes deny historical circumstances and ignore the diversity of Native peoples.

 Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design is manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not always the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came somewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the ever-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy in the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there were important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, an architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his native country through two architecture and design magazines he founded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in the pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, unlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected modernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, however, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy expanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.One pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware of the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design—the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues between 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development Incorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution in Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by more than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, and industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  among the host institutions, the lionâs share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a center for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study and work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.

 Damian Wampler’s series Darfur in Brooklyn, to which this image belongs, is an oblique portrait of a crisis. Brooklyn is home to more than three hundred Sudanese refugees, most of them living in the borough’s Kensington section, not far from Prospect Park. Through following one of them, the cab driver Omer Omar (shown here in his kitchen), for several months, Wampler presents a powerful portrait of the daily life of a little-known population in the Museum’s extended neighborhood.

 Arlene Shechet, a ceramicist and sculptor, also creates handmade papers from abacá, a plant native to the Philippines and prized for its delicate fibers. These works simultaneously make reference to the floor plans of Buddhist shrines, Japanese aizuri-e prints, and blue-and-white porcelain. The Flow Blue series, from which this work derives, is named after a particular type of British transfer pottery popular during the early nineteenth century. Modeled after Asian blue-and-white porcelain, these wares are known for their deliberately blurred forms mimicking the marbled appearance of lapis lazuli.
