Here she uses clay, an ancient artistic medium, to depict a traditional Pueblo woman, whose face is much like Swentzell\u2019s own. The woman in the sculpture looks up at the Santa Clara black pot balanced on her head, from which babies are emerging. But there is a contemporary ironic twist to what the woman is doing: is she \u201cbirthing\u201d pots to be sold at an Indian market, or is it the baby Indians themselves that the consumer will want to buy? The work challenges the viewer to acknowledge the treatment of Native Americans as a stereotype and commodity in representations by non-natives in popular culture and advertising.",

The women appear blurry and ghostlike, almost as if they have been transported to another world through the glowing screens. It is the inanimate physical objects throughout the room that come into view in detail, hinting at the transience of human existence as well as the sometimes alienating effects of contemporary communication. Pillsbury uses ambient lighting produced by the electronic devices that permeate our lives\u2014such as televisions, computer screens, and cell phones\u2014combined with long exposure times to create photographs that examine our relationships with these devices and the objects and people around us.",

At this point in his story, friendly birds fly off when Alice talks about what her cat likes to eat. In Kiki Smith's prints based on fairytales, childhood vulnerability and innocence like Alice's can be imbued with a sense of the sexual awakening that accompanies adolescence, and the animals sometimes shown with young girls suggest underlying forces of nature. Here we witness a cryptic scene, as Alice watches winged forms, some of them with incongruous limbs, fly away from her.",

Trained at the University of Wisconsin and the Rhode Island School of Design, he received the first Fulbright Fellowship in glass and went to Venice in 1968 to study at Venini, the most progressive glass factory in Italy. In 1971 he established the Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle, the only American art school devoted entirely to glassmaking. His affinity for the Northwest is profound; he has strong ties to the landscape and great interest in the arts of the native peoples there. This particular work was inspired by the traditional woven baskets of the Haida and other Northwest Coast tribes.Chihuly has moved from small-scale vases of recognizable form to art that transcends the boundaries of traditional glassmaking. As this \"basket\" demonstrates, he has abandoned functionalism in favor of large sculptural forms. Often he and his assistants work on a grand scale, creating large environments composed of many thousands of glass elements for specific sites. In 1994, he created Brooklyn Wall, a temporary installation in the Museum's lobby.",

It represents a killer whale, one of the crest designs of the Tlingit glass-blower Preston Singletary. The surface incorporates traditional form-line designs with the black outlining the positive, primary spaces and the deeply cut red shaping the negative, secondary spaces of the whale's body. This reflects the same style of design used in traditional mediums such as totem poles, Tlingit Chilkat blankets, rattles, and other ritual paraphernalia. All such artworks reflect visual histories and designs owned by hereditary right by each Native artist.\n\r\nSingletary trained at the famous Pilchuck Glass School in Seattle with glass artists such as Lino Tagliapetra and Cicco Ongaro but credits the Isleta Pueblo glassblower Tony Jojola with inspiring him to switch from making European-style works to creating from within his own Tlingit culture. Singletary has become the leader of a rapidly developing, innovative Native American glass art movement.",

These Congolese works represent opposite ends of the social spectrum. \n\r\nThe mwaash aMbooy mask is emblematic of royal power and prestige for the Kuba kingdom of the central Congo. It represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba trace their descent, and is worn only by the king (nyim) or by local chiefs. In both its dance and as a sculpture, it is a vision of gravity and composure. \n\r\nThe contemporary portraits by Aim\u00e9 Mpane, in turn, depict the struggles of those without access to power. They show ordinary citizens of Kinshasa, along with representations of their fears and desires. The artist carves these images from plywood, turning two-dimensional surfaces into works filled with light and shadow (suggesting both presence and absence) that animate the stories of the dispossessed.",

Later, during the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), the technique was used for utilitarian vessels, including water jars, large pots, and farming implements. Only after the Muromachi period (1392\u20131573) was Shigaraki ware used for tea bowls.",

Subtly addressing issues of racial and gender identity in American society, she juxtaposed text with her photographs, continually presenting her female subject as anonymous by hiding part of her face or choosing a view of the figure\u2019s back. Thus the viewer never knew these women as individuals. \n\r\nIn Counting, Simpson presents us with three images: an African American woman, a brick hut, and braids. As in most of her work, the meaning is open-ended, but the adjacent texts suggest that the work deals with labor and slavery. The woman is paired with time slots that could imply work shifts. Text alluding to the beginning of slavery appears with a Southern smokehouse once used as a slave hut. The image of braids coupled with the text \u201c25 twists, 70 braids, 50 locks\u201d implies the arrangement of multiple, intricate braids, a cultural trait sometimes associated with African American women.",

Echoing the paradisical scene, with its references to the sacrificial lamb of the Crucifixion and the fountain of life, Woodruff places a plentitude of apples, birds, and rabbits around a wishing well. As in the proverb \u201can apple a day,\u201d the apples suggest the possibility of healing and overcoming the menace of AIDS through hope, joy, and appreciation of the everyday miracles of life.

            "description": "When Astroland first opened in 1962, it included two of the classic Coney Island rides: the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel (left of center in this image). In 2006 the owners sold Astroland to a developer who had already assembled a large amount of land in Coney Island\u2019s old amusement area. A short-term lease will allow Astroland to reopen next summer, but as this text goes to press, it remains unclear whether the developer\u2019s plan for towering hotels, shops, restaurants, movie theaters, and high-tech entertainment will be accepted or rebuffed by city authorities.\n\r\nIn the past few years, attempts to revitalize Coney Island have increased; KeySpan Park and the new Stillwell Avenue subway station are the most obvious examples. While many agree that rejuvenation is necessary, voices have been raised against the prospect of turning Coney Island into a gentrified enclave for the well-off. New York City\u2019s creation of a Coney Island Development Corporation in 2003 brought together city officials as well as local business and community leaders. This initiative indicated awareness of the importance of caring for the area\u2019s traditional qualities and of keeping it available to a diverse audience while providing a wide-ranging plan for economic development that would include a year-round amusement district as well as many new residential opportunities. At this moment, it is uncertain what the result of these efforts will be.",

Postwar suburbanization, car culture, and the creation of parkways and public state parks such as Jones Beach offered people alternatives for day trips in the summer. Robert Moses, New York City\u2019s powerful Parks Commissioner, objected to the kind of entertainment Coney offered with its penny arcades, shooting galleries, rides, and sideshows. In 1938 his Parks Department took control of the beach at Coney Island, with efforts to increase public access and reduce the amusements. In the 1950s and 1960s large areas were used for new housing projects built on Moses\u2019s initiative. Widespread gang violence in the 1950s frightened some visitors, and when Steeplechase closed for good in 1964, the area dedicated to amusement was dramatically reduced. Nevertheless, Coney Island as a democratic destination for everyone subsisted, as testified here in Stephen Salmieri\u2019s many images from the late 1960s.",

Returning to Cuba in 1980 and 1981, she continued to trace female forms on the ground, as in the pieces executed on the beach in Guanabo. She also began carving fertility figures into the caves and cliffs of her native land, which she called Rupestrian Sculptures. Many of these, such as the large Untitled (Guanaroca [First Woman]), were named after indigenous goddesses, simultaneously serving as political and personal assertions of Mendieta\u2019s presence and identity, as well as reminders of ancient traditions of goddess worship.",

To this end, in 1884 the city council of Calais commissioned Rodin to create a monument to Eustache de Saint-Pierre. In 1347, while Calais was under siege by the English, Eustache and five other important citizens of the town had offered themselves as hostages, pleading for mercy for their long-suffering city.In his first maquette of 1884, Rodin proposed a conventional monument, with his figures united as a group on a tall pedestal. By the following year, however, the six figures were placed on a low rectangular plinth, at the same level as the viewer. As Rodin later wrote: \"I wanted to have my statues placed in front of the Calais city hall on the very paving of the square like a living rosary of suffering and sacrifice.\"Rodin first made nude figure studies, which he then draped in wet canvas to model the sackcloth worn by the burghers when they surrendered. To create the expressive figures possible, he used the radical technique of combining studies of hands and feet from different figures. Creating the very antithesis of conventional heroic sculpture, Rodin here set out the terms of a modern, anti-monumental tradition that resonates to this day.",
