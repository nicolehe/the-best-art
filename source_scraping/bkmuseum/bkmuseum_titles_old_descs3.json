This piece, however, has been attributed to Areogun of Osi, one of the most prominent Yoruba artists of the twentieth century. His distinctive style is identifiable in the figure's elaborate openwork headdress, proportionally large ears, and curved breasts.Kneeling female figures, often nude, are common in Yoruba religious art. In this pose, the figure represents a supplicant before the orisha, or deity, on whose altar it is placed. The image beautifies the altar and thereby honors orisha.",

The archaic features, weathered surface, and evidence of local repairs suggest that the nineteenth-century mask (far left) was a work of considerable local importance. It may represent an intellectual and visual predecessor of the twentieth-century version.\n\r\nThe Senufo kponyugu masks are both horizontal composite animal forms with long, projecting horns, a large, gaping mouth, and fearsome accoutrements such as sharp teeth and claws. Such details relate to Senufo cosmology, legends, and beliefs about the connections between certain animals and the ancestral and nature spirits that connect the living.

Indian modernist artists of the early twentieth century would cite Kalighat paintings as a source of inspiration, noting that their Indian predecessors were abstracting the human form even before European painters.",

In Old Trombola Grigoriev heightens his sitter\u2019s emotional state by emphasizing his intense gaze and exaggerating the sculptural qualities of his weathered hands and face. Grigoriev later wrote, \u201cI have been watching and studying the Russian people for many years ... and these paintings are the fruits of my observations.\u201d",

Although the prototype\u2014made for a 1946 exhibition of British industrial design\u2014was a critical success, Benjamin Bowden failed in his attempts to have it manufactured. By the time it finally went into production in the United States in 1960, tastes had changed and the price of the bicycle\u2014$89.50\u2014was too high. It is believed that only about five hundred examples were ever sold, making it one of the rarest and most sought-after industrial designs of the mid-twentieth century.

The form of the shakers was inspired by realistic Japanese metal objects with which Americans were just becoming familiar, and their maker used a newly invented process to patinate the silver to resemble weathered copper. The irregular, ergonomic contour and dense Southwestern landscape of the flask would have also seemed quite daring to the original purchaser. In contrast, the all-over, hard-edged design of the later flask evokes the emerging, dynamic skyscraper skyline of big cities, and the unadorned, pyramidal forms of the later salt and pepper shakers have a timeless quality. While all of these objects were progressive when made, only the later ones still speak the language of modern design.",

Little is known about the function of these masks, however, though it is usually said that they represent the spirits of ancestors returning to the village.

Thompson was born near Louisville, Kentucky, and studied at the University of Louisville and at Boston University. In the early and mid-1960s, he traveled throughout Europe and experienced many Renaissance paintings and other artworks firsthand. He fused the vigor and vibrancy of Expressionism with themes from Old Master compositions and the vivid palette of Fauve painting to create the original visual vocabulary exemplified by The Judgment. Recalling such time-honored Old Master subjects as the Last Judgment and the Judgment of Paris, here a nude male trio sits before faceless winged female angels while two figures (at left) await judgment. The planar, flattened figures and compositional contours in a gesturally applied background are all equally emphasized.",

            "description": "When Lois Mailou Jones painted Leigh Whipper, the latter was at the height of his career as a Broadway and Hollywood actor. Within months of sitting for this portrait, Whipper would be famous for his role as Crooks in the 1939 movie adaptation of John Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice and Men. Whipper\u2019s character\u2014a handicapped stable hand ostracized because of his race\u2014served to illuminate the movie\u2019s Depressionera message that the American Dream\u2019s promise of economic and social success was impossible.\n\r\nThis portrait shows Whipper as if seated at a Paris caf\u00e9. Jones herself had recently returned from a sabbatical in France and was teaching at Howard University in Washington, D.C. There she came under the influence of the Harlem Renaissance intellectual Alain Locke. Her portrayal of a pensive Whipper answered Locke\u2019s call for black artists to create ennobling portrayals of African Americans.",

The origin of the glass beads may have contributed to the value of these items, as they were often imported from the southern islands of Japan or other foreign sources, traveling through extensive trade routes that linked the Ainu to distant communities in Manchuria and Sakhalin, among others.",

The juxtaposed slabs of color play off one another, as some squares seem to recede into space while others float into the foreground. Albers pursued this study of color and perception from 1950 until his death, producing nearly a thousand canvases in the series.",

            "description": "Today when we think of where inventive contemporary design \r\nis manufactured, we often think of Italy. This, however, was not \r\nalways the case. Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

In keeping with the extraordinary popularity of public rodeos during the Depression era, here the artist took on the theme of rodeo roughriders. The dynamism of the scene, in which two men help a third off a bucking horse, is enhanced by Beal\u2019s brushy application of paint and use of bold lines.",

Throughout his long career, Lawrence devoted himself to painting genre scenes of working-class black life and epic series about African American history. Displaying the abstracted design elements and vibrant colors that characterize Lawrence\u2019s style, Funeral Sermon commemorates the death of his sister from tuberculosis in 1944. An expression of personal grief, this work also addresses larger social issues, including the importance of spirituality in the black community\u2014notice how Lawrence unifies the congregation in the foreground through the repetition of geometric forms\u2014and the overcrowded housing and inadequate health-care facilities in Harlem that led to disease and untimely death.",

Particularly interested in the narrative and details of the Crucifixion, Stuck devoted several canvases to this subject late in his career, during the difficult years of World War I. Calling on new scholarly theories regarding the Gospel accounts, Stuck departs from tradition and places Christ at eye level with the witnesses to his sufferings. The artist cleverly structures his composition, placing the viewer immediately to the left of the crucified thief in the foreground and to the right of the haloed Virgin Mary, thereby closing a solemn yet intimate circle. Stuck also chooses to show Christ with his feet side by side rather than overlapping\u2014again, referencing nineteenth-century debates about the historical details of this method of execution.",

When he immigrated to the United States as a teenager, he encountered the iconography of the modern Machine Age\u2014skyscrapers, factories, bridges, railroads\u2014that would fascinate him for the remainder of his career. In Tanks (No. 1), Lozowick creates a celebratory vision of a nocturnal industrial landscape with a monumental storage tank rising heroically through a lattice of pipes and scaffolding. The image also speaks to progress through the juxtaposition of an airplane and a team of horses. Mastery of the lithographic medium is evident in the velvety surfaces and subtle tonal gradations, while the simplification of forms and faceted planes reveal Lozowick's debt to Cubism, Russian Constructivism, and other avant-garde styles that he saw during his travels in Europe in the 1920s.",

The work makes reference to Pop art and the work of Pablo Picasso, as well as the political ferment of the early 1960s. In reflecting on this work and the political and artistic awakening she experienced during this period, Ringgold has said, \u201cI was trying to find my voice, talking to myself through my art.\u201d",

Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea\u2019a\u2019ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).",
