In order to own and perform with a mask, a man had to symbolically marry it by paying the carver a copper ring as a bride price. In so doing, the dancer made a commitment to honor and care for the spirit represented by the mask. In return, the dancer was able to earn his livelihood performing at local festivals.",

He recalled his eagerness to do a portrait of Hartley, whose face he considered \"typically American\" and \"very sensitive.\" This penetrating portrayal was done the year before Hartley's death at sixty-six and poignantly captures the painter's age and melancholy. The monumentality of the profile is in marked contrast to the wasted and drawn features of the frontal view, with its tragic overtones. Lipchitz commented that this brooding likeness of a fellow artist had been \"made for myself as an exercise and demonstration.\" In fact, it required twenty-seven life sittings to complete Hartley's portrait. This cast, one of seven, belonged to the collectors Edith and Milton Lowenthal, who also left the Museum a rich legacy of nine paintings by Marsden Hartley.",

She later recalled,  \"It was very interesting because you could see how he would put a strong stroke in the painting--I couldn't see the painting, but I could see him as he worked on it. At one point he said there was an awful lot of white, so he went around the studio and came up with a dusty piece of blue linen that he draped over my shoulder.\"",

Throughout the 1920s artists often engaged living, natural forms as surrogates for the human body in works that celebrated physical presence as an antidote to modern, mechanized lives. Among his earliest freestanding sculptures (Laurent had previously carved frames and two-dimensional reliefs), this work is one of a small handful of plant and flame subjects by the artist.",

After a visit to Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s 291 gallery in New York, Strand dedicated himself to the modernist aesthetic. Although his early interests focused on urban sites and machinery, eventually he turned to nature and portraiture in his search for purity of vision. His simple, straightforward portraits gradually became a quest for ideal beauty, seen in the inherent dignity of his subjects. \n\r\nStrand left the United States in the early 1950s to escape McCarthyism and lived in France for the rest of his life. He also travelled widely and spent long periods of time in Italy, the Outer Hebrides, Egypt, and Ghana. Strand turned experiences from his trips into photographic books, in which he tried to encapsulate the distinctive character of the places and the people he photographed. In this portrait from Egypt of Sheik Ali Gournah, Strand sought a precise vision of character through contrast, texture, and light. This technique expresses what he termed \u201can aesthetic based on the objective nature of reality.\u201d",

The earliest documented examples date to the reign of King Djoser in the Third Dynasty (circa 2675\u20132625 B.C.).This New Kingdom pair statue represents a married couple. The inscription tells us that the man is Nebsen, a scribe in the royal treasury, and the woman is Nebet-ta, a singer in the temple of the goddess Isis. They each pass one arm behind the other, a symbol closeness. In order to convey this sentiment and to create a harmonious design, the sculptor extended the arms to unnatural lengths.",

A small, concealed bar, with etched glass walls that salute France, is hidden in the corner in defiance of Prohibition, which forbade alcohol consumption in the United States from 1919 to 1933. Interestingly, while this room was furnished in the Art Deco style, the public rooms in the rest of the Worgelt apartment were furnished in a more conservative French eighteenth-century-revival style.",

Such figures are considered a point of access to the spirit of a departed twin, and an icon of status for a mother of twins. \n\r\nWorn on the heads of male dancers, ci-wara headdresses are danced in male and female pairs to symbolize the fertility of land and animals.

In this painting, she has pushed the composition in the direction of abstraction by cropping the tree forms abruptly at the canvas\u2019s edge, bringing focus to the V formed by the converging tree trunks. This V, painted in New Mexico a few months after Stieglitz\u2019s death, may also be endowed with personal meaning. The two sets of bare tree trunks, rooted to each other in the ground but grown apart, may be a subtle reference to her partnership with Stieglitz, frayed by the end of his life because of his attentions to another woman.\n\r\nThis painting can be seen hanging in O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Ghost Ranch studio in the 1948 short film by Henwar Rodakiewicz, Land of Enchantment: Southwest U.S.A, on view nearby.",

The vanity and stool are made of chromed metal tubing, an innovation in furniture construction pioneered in the early 1920s by Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus, the seminal German school for modern design. It was still a startling new material a decade later. \n\r\nAlthough the vanity is gender-specific, this stark, modern interpretation has a limited palette and is made of new materials with hard surfaces. Updating an old form, Kem Weber transformed it for the modern woman.",

Moreover, moldable glass allowed the handle of the Silver Streak to conform to the user\u2019s hand, illustrating again the interest in ergonomics\u2014the study of the way things work with the body\u2014among designers of this time.

The two dead cod most likely allude to the 1936 drowning of Alton and Donald Mason, sons of a Nova Scotia fishing family with whom he lived during the summers of 1935 and 1936. Hartley linked the deaths of his beloved friends to Christ\u2019s martyrdom through the traditional Christian symbolism of the fish.

There, he was influenced by European modernist styles that his artist friends were exploring and by Japanese design and iconography, seen here in the monochromatic and flattened composition.

The multicolored geometric designs brocaded on the front, back, and shoulders of this huipil identify it as Quiche Maya from Chichicastenango. An abstract double-headed eagle motif appears on the front and back center panels as well as on the shoulders. Black silk appliqu\u00e9s decorate the sunburst design and four disks around the neck opening, representing the four cardinal directions.\n\r\nIn agricultural societies such as the Maya, clothing designs relate to the natural world and have the power to protect the wearer from supernatural harm. When opened and laid flat, the huipil design has cosmological significance: the head opening becomes the sun, surrounded by the four directions and other designs inspired by the natural world. The wearer is therefore placed at the center of the universe.",

            "description": "Albert Swinden\u2019s abstractions have been referred to as \u201ccalmly classical visions.\u201d These words provide an apt description for this mural specifically, with its carefully balanced, disciplined composition of rectangular shapes punctuated by occasional biomorphic forms. Swinden seldom wrote about his art, but his brief essay \u201cOn Simplification,\u201d published in the 1938 American Abstract Artists Yearbook, provides a succinct comment on the aesthetic concerns embodied in this mural. \u201cWe are moved not only by particular, or individual forms,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut by the relationships between the particular forms and their significance as a unity.\u201d\n\r\nSwinden\u2019s Williamsburg mural does not conform to his original conception for it. The changes he made (such as the addition of a black horizontal strip of canvas at the top and a wide, broken band of blue on the right) were probably in response to the demands of the specific space in which the mural was installed at the Williamsburg Housing Project. Similarly, the two inserts of unpainted canvas in the upper right and left corners represent areas occupied by structural beams at the mural\u2019s original Williamsburg site. Swinden was born in Birmingham, England, and lived in Canada from the age of seven until his immigration to the United States in 1919. After studying at The Art Institute of Chicago for about eighteen months, he settled in New York City. There he enrolled in art classes at the National Academy of Design but soon decided to attend the Art Students League instead, where he studied from 1930 to 1934 and began to teach in 1932. He also studied for a time with the influential artist Hans Hofmann.\n\r\nDespite his association with, and position of respect among, some of the most progressive artists of his day, Swinden was unsuccessful in promoting his art in the commercial sphere. Although he was instrumental in founding the American Abstract Artists, was selected by Burgoyne Diller to execute important murals for the Williamsburg Housing Project and the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, and was included in many group exhibitions in the 1940s, he often supported himself working as a textile designer or an engineering draftsman. Even though Swinden painted steadily throughout his life, his oeuvre is comparatively small. In addition, most of his early paintings were destroyed in 1940 in a fire at the studio he shared with Balcomb Greene (whose Williamsburg mural is also on view nearby). These facts increase the historical and aesthetic significance of Swinden\u2019s \u201crediscovered\u201d Williamsburg mural, for it now stands as a rare, and possibly the most important, surviving example of his early work.",

            "description": "Paul Kelpe\u2019s Williamsburg murals, like those of Bolotowsky, Greene, and Swinden, were conceived as entirely nonobjective compositions. However, they reveal a distinctly different approach to abstraction. Kelpe is unique among these artists for his strikingly unusual color combinations, his decorative patterning of selected fields of color, and his sculpturesque forms suggesting axial rotation.\n\r\nKelpe was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists and participated actively in the organization as an exhibitor and an officeholder. Despite the stance of unity among the organization\u2019s members in their desire to promote the acceptance of abstraction, Kelpe\u2019s work provoked considerable criticism from within the group. His critics, most of whom favored the gridded geometries inspired by Mondrian, deplored his persistence in maintaining an illusionistic, three-dimensional space in which his abstract geometric solids float. Kelpe was thoroughly familiar with the European avant-garde. Born in Minden, Germany, he studied art history and architecture in Hanover, where he gained firsthand knowledge of the work of Kurt Schwitters, Wassily Kandinsky, and the Russian Constructivists, among others. After immigrating to the United States in 1925, he settled in Chicago in 1931. When he applied to the Chicago Regional Mural Division of the Federal Art Project, his application was denied because his bold abstract imagery did not correspond with the realistically rendered portrayals of American life that the Chicago office preferred. This rejection spurred him to move to New York City, where his abstractions found a more favorable response from Burgoyne Diller, who hired him to participate in the New York City Works Progress Administration Mural Program at Williamsburg.\n\r\nAlthough Kelpe continued to paint and exhibit frequently, he also pursued more academic aspects of art and earned a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate in art history from the University of Chicago in 1948 and 1957, respectively. After teaching art history at the university level for many years, he retired in 1969 to devote himself to painting.",

            "description": "The cool austerity revealed in Balcomb Greene\u2019s mural displayed here provides a visual equivalent to the intellectual concerns he articulated in many essays and lectures throughout his career. Born in Milville, New York, and raised in the Midwest, Greene earned a B.A. in philosophy from Syracuse University in 1926. His introduction to the art world was through the young artist Gertrude Glass, whom he met in 1926 and married shortly thereafter. Greene went on for graduate study in psychology in Vienna in 1927. On returning to the United States, he shifted his focus to English literature, studying at Columbia University and then teaching at Dartmouth College from 1928 to 1931. Thereafter, the Greenes went to Paris, where Gertrude pursued her own career and Balcomb continued to write\u2014poetry and fiction\u2014and also became more deeply engaged with contemporary art. In Paris both Balcomb and Gertrude Greene found aesthetic affinity with the ideas of the Abstraction-Creation group, which emphasized pure plastic (or formal) elements such as line, color, and shape, and rejected anecdotal or natural elements and identifiable\r\nsubject matter.\n\r\nGreene\u2019s relatively sudden embrace of painting met with early success, and he had his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1931. The Greenes returned to New York in 1932. Although Balcomb continued to write, his attention was increasingly drawn to painting. As a founder and the first chairman of the American Abstract Artists, Greene was an important force in promoting the group\u2019s beliefs both in his paintings and in print.\n\r\nIn the late 1930s Greene worked for the Mural Division of the WPA/FAP, executing this Williamsburg mural and another important one for the Federal Hall of Medicine at the 1939 World\u2019s Fair. He also earned a master\u2019s degree in art history at New York University in 1941.\n\r\nFrom 1942 to 1959 Greene taught art history and aesthetics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. Although he continued to paint and exhibit actively, he was no longer affiliated with any particular artists\u2019 group or communal aesthetic or sociopolitical efforts. His work of the 1930s underscored his belief that art should be impersonal\u2014as shown here in the cool remoteness of this mural\u2014yet he turned in the early 1940s to an abstract idiom that relied on identifiable objects, a manner that he explored in his late paintings created in the Long Island studio that became his base in 1959.",

            "description": "Of the four artists represented here, Ilya Bolotowsky achieved the greatest and most sustained measure of recognition. An intellectually and physically energetic man, he had wideranging interests that encompassed writing short stories and plays, collecting Eskimo and other North American Indian art, and making his own documentary and experimental films. Bolotowsky was primarily a painter, however, and was among the first of his generation to paint abstractions.\n\r\nBolotowsky was born in Petrograd, Russia, to staunchly anti-Communist parents who later fled the country for political reasons. After some years in Constantinople, where he attended St. Joseph\u2019s College from 1921 to 1923, his family finally settled in New York in 1923. From 1924 to 1930 Bolotowsky studied at the National Academy of Design, where he was trained to work in a figurative manner. In 1933, however, he saw paintings by Piet Mondrian and Joan Mir\u00f3 and was moved by their example to experiment in an entirely nonfigurative mode. As demonstrated in his Williamsburg mural displayed here, he had, by 1936, fully embraced an idiom that testifies to his admiration for Mir\u00f3 in both its lively interaction of hard-edged geometric and biomorphic shapes and its use of bright, unmodeled areas of color. The issue of pictorial space versus flatness was central to discussions among the members of the American Abstract Artists, in which Bolotowsky figured prominently. This mural may be seen to incorporate the two opposing approaches; some of his shapes seem to cavort in a vaguely illusionistic space, while others appear to be solidly anchored on the painting\u2019s surface, emphasizing the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.\n\r\nBy the 1940s Bolotowsky had devoted himself to the strict Neoplasticism of Mondrian. He continued to create his own variations on geometric abstraction for the rest of his career.",

Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea\u2019a\u2019ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).",

As with the Surrealists who practiced automatism, Gorky\u2019s imagery revealed itself only in the process of creation, as pictorial ideas gradually emerged from the subconscious depths of the mind.\n\r\nYet on another level, it is interesting to note that Gorky volunteered to serve in the camouflage section of the U.S. Army (though he was rejected on grounds of age). And he organized a class in camouflage painting, at the Grand Central School of Art in New York, because, as he wrote, such work would help the artist \u201cdeepen and enrich his understanding of art as well as make him an important contributor to civilian and military defense.\u201d Beyond the self-absorbed practices of the Surrealists, therefore, he felt that art could also play a role in the war effort.\n\r\nThis particular work has been compared to Picasso\u2019s Guernica, painted a few years earlier, which Gorky is known to have admired. Both are intensely personal responses to the violence of war.",

He later headed the photography department at the Dar al-funun, a European-inspired institution of higher learning where artists learned how to produce portraits in various media and traditions. \u2018Abdallah Qajar also owned a commercial studio next to the Dar al-funun, which suggests that there was a market for photography outside of the court. The artist\u2019s repertoire consists mostly of landscapes and portraits of high-ranking officials and royal family members. Here, Muzaffar al-Din Shah\u2019s informal attire is emphasized by a couple of unbuttoned buttons on his overcoat.",
