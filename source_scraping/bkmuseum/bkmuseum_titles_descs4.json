Encased in a glass box with a wooden floor and frames, the replica of a Datura plant in this piece has been domesticated. With leaves half-devoured by insects, it looks deceptively harmless\u2014and still quite beautiful\u2014in its decaying state. Nevertheless, the Datura is a dangerously poisonous plant. It contains scopolamine and atropine, which in very low doses can be used both as medications and as powerful hallucinogens, transporting the user to otherworldly states of consciousness. Yet, an overdose of these substances is fatal.",

The artist Fritz Scholder referred to himself as a non-Indian Indian, someone who never felt the pull of two different cultures.

Instead, he offers an amorphous human form, showing only a scruffy face with an open mouth, though the hint of a warrior breastplate, the wrapped braids, and the sharply angled feather suggest a Native American identity. The figure\u2019s tightly wrapped blanket and his turned pose seem to reject empathy from the viewer.",

The capacity to transform the documentary into poetry, to interpret a scene on the street from a humanistic perspective and give it a new meaning, is a key feature of Brooklyn-born Levitt's lifelong photographic practice, always more artistic than journalistic.  \n\r\nThe seemingly simple structure of this image reveals a skillful sense of composition. The graffiti and the many layers of advertisements on the back wall echo the black scribbles on the face of the boy on the left, his vertically striped pants juxtaposed with the horizontal bands of the wall in the background. Quietly and full of concentration, he is gazing at the other boy, slightly out of focus, carefully handling a bubble.\n\r\nLevitt studied with Walker Evans in New York in the late 1930s and began photographing city children in the 1940s, always imbuing her subjects with characteristic warmth. In 1970, she was one of the first street photographers to begin working in color.",

In Keys to the Coop, Walker depicts a young African American girl in bold silhouette, holding the decapitated head of a chicken in one hand, while in the other she nonchalantly twirls a large key. Walker portrays a self-empowered anti-heroine who possesses the key to her own salvation, in stark black-and-white. This image also provocatively alludes to food, gender, and racial mythologies, subjects that Walker often foregrounds in her work.",

Yantras are spiritual visualization instruments specific to the philosophy and ritual of Tantra, a sect of both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Kali yantra is a red and black diagram of interlocking triangles, lotus petals, and geometric forms, and is one of several symbolic representations of shakti (female divine energy). The inverted triangle also resonates with the contemporary use of pink and black triangles as symbols of queer identity.\n\r\n\u2014CG\n\r\n[Text not currently in gallery]",

Schapiro is a pioneering feminist artist who, with Judy Chicago, founded the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, the first program of its kind to encourage women to make art from their personal experiences. A leader in the Pattern and Decoration movement, Schapiro is known for her \u201cfemmages,\u201d or collage paintings, which aim to reclaim traditional handicrafts associated with women\u2019s work, such as embroidery and sewing. Stylistically this painting mimics the look of a collage, recalling Schapiro\u2019s long-standing commitment to the belief that decorative elements and women\u2019s work are viable artistic means to express female experience, having both political and subversive potential.",

The artist began The Inversion as a larger work, and it forms a narrative about the painting process: \"The landscape originally stretched horizontally from left to right, side to side,\" she wrote. \"I cropped it because it didn't work\u2014the negation of some areas becomes a positive element in the support of the total picture.\" In other words, the void at the right is a kind of negative \"inversion\" of the positive landscape.",

In that series, she described how the male gaze reduces the female subject to stereotype. \n\r\nThe series Fairy Tales and Disasters of the mid- to late 1980s marked a major shift in Sherman\u2019s self-representation. External appearance became the means by which to explore the contents of an internal world, one influenced by fairytales, myths, and fantasy. If the Untitled Film Stills expressed a sense of anxiety about the lurking male gaze, then the Fairy Tales, such as this one, reveal a monstrous \u201cother\u201d we all carry inside. The harsh, sickly greenish-yellow lighting emphasizes the slobbering lips, decaying teeth, and tense fists of this character. The vulnerable girls and alluring temptresses of the Film Stills are replaced by grotesque figures emerging from some netherworld.",

Here, Mom and I explored a new approach to documenting our illnesses (mine being lupus). We stood our mattress on end and covered it with a comforter, essentially making it our studio/stage. We made a portrait of our bodies overlapping as one, unified in sickness, death, and our struggle to survive. The light cast a shadow that for me foreshadows the loss of Grandma Ruby; she passed away six months later from pancreatic cancer. \n\r\n\u2014LaToya Ruby Frazier\n\r\n[Text not currently in gallery]",

In this painting she painstakingly describes the geometry created by a patterned parquet floor strewn with articles of clothing. Using exaggerated perspective, the artist leads us into the depth of space, implying the large scale of the room. In contrast to the elaborately set up interiors that were the subject of paintings through the nineteenth century, Mangold presents a segment of a modern household where everyone is rushing, and tidying up is the last thing on anyone's mind.",

He dubbed these site-specific transformations \u201cAnarchitecture\u201d (a combination of \u201canarchy\u201d and \u201carchitecture\u201d); they were documented in films and photographs that were subsequently exhibited in galleries, sometimes alongside sections of the cut-out buildings. \n\r\nIn connection with his Super 8mm film Underground Paris (1977), exploring the complex underground spaces of the city, Matta-Clark made a series of photographic works of the same title. These represent another type of cut, this time deep into the ground, where the built environment is contrasted with the city\u2019s many buried stories. In Underground Paris: St. Michel, Matta-Clark photographed the catacombs beneath the center of Paris and created a larger image by combining many smaller photographs, often making visible the edges of the strips of negatives. This montage of several similar-looking images, both color and black and white, refers back to the Super 8mm film, taking a form like a filmstrip. At the same time, the horizontal seams between the images allude to geological layers, just as the work\u2019s extreme vertical format mimics the descending movement necessary to reach these hidden and forgotten burial grounds. The city is visible above, with its roofline and the highlighted silhouette of a church emphasizing the contrast between past and present.",

It is part of a larger series by Jack Whitten honoring black visionaries in politics and the arts, many of whom (including Ellison) Whitten knew. \n\r\nTo create this mosaic-like painting, Whitten made tiles composed of organic materials and acrylic paint and applied them to a canvas. The tiles each have a unique chemistry, with embedded materials that are symbolic. According to Whitten, the figure\u2019s acrylic-encased razor-blade mouth references the \u201cdouble edge of black identity,\u201d which \u201ccuts both ways.\u201d The illumination radiating from the figure alludes to one of Whitten\u2019s favorite sentences in Invisible Man: \u201cThe truth is the light and the light is the truth.\u201d",

To brighten the view on the Israeli side, the wall has been painted with a landscape, the view as it would have been without the Palestinian village on the opposite side. The elegant composition, muted colors, and smooth tonalities of the photograph add to its almost otherworldly character. Norfolk's use of an old-fashioned mahogany and brass field camera\u2014a large-format view camera with a slow shutter speed\u2014also contributes to the epic quality of the image: a beauty in conflict, or at least in jarring juxtaposition, with the problematic subject at hand. Norfolk's extraordinary ability to fuse the timeless and the topical resonates with the Museum\u2019s great collection of landscape paintings steeped in meaning, most notably the \u201cGreat Pictures\u201d of the American West, such as Alfred Bierstadt\u2019s A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt.

The original photograph appeared in Life Magazine in 1986 and featured a Harlem Globetrotter in front of the Statue of Liberty, spinning a basketball on his finger. Interested in popular culture, photographic history, and sports as a metaphor for individual and collective struggle, Thomas created a lifesize sculpture of the moment by casting the arm of retired NBA All-Star Juwan Howard. \n\nLiberty is part of Thomas\u2019s Punctum series, which draws inspiration from the French philosopher Roland Barthes\u2019s idea of the punctum: that \u201celement which rises from the [photographic] scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces.\u201d Using this concept as his foundation, Thomas selects a specific area of an image and re-presents it as sculpture. Through cropping and isolation, he encourages us to contemplate framing itself: what is left in or out of a photograph, narrative, or account of a historical event, and why?",

This is my way of saying yes to us.\r\n\u00a0\n-Kehinde Wiley\n\n\u00a0\nHistorically, the role of portraiture has been not only to create a likeness but also to communicate ideas about the subject's status, wealth, and power. During the eighteenth century, for example, major patrons from the church and the aristocracy commissioned portraits in part to signify their importance in society. This portrait imitates the posture of the figure of Napoleon Bonaparte in Jacques-Louis David's painting Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at Grand-Saint-Bernard. Wiley transforms the traditional equestrian portrait by substituting an anonymous young Black man dressed in contemporary clothing for the figure of Napoleon. The artist thereby confronts and critiques historical traditions that do not acknowledge Black cultural experience. Wiley presents a new brand of portraiture that redefines and affirms Black identity and simultaneously questions the history of Western painting.",

Adejoke Tugbiyele\u2019s art advocates for richer and more humane understandings of identity and status, particularly with regard to sexual orientation.\n\r\nHere, Tugbiyele takes discarded and low-value materials, including palm stems, and weaves them into a figure imbued with the colors of the gay pride flag. At the same time, the figure sits in a gesture that evokes a life lived on the streets and wears a mask to conceal the subject\u2019s identity.",

Whether it is the awkwardness of Rineke Dijkstra\u2019s gangly prepubescents or the sexuality, malaise, and dysfunction depicted by Larry Clark, the worlds of adolescents and teenagers seem to have been exhaustively described. \n\r\nWhile Lise Sarfati continues to mine this rich vein of subject matter, she evokes a slightly different tone. In her first book of photographs, Acta Est, she documented the dark, emotional territory of wayward youth in post-Soviet Russia. Robin, #43, Oakland, CA is from her subsequent project, titled The American Series. Published in book form as The New Life, the series comprises images of young people from Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, and California. Directionless, dispossessed, and dejected, these young people (mainly young women) appear ghost-like and unattached to their surroundings. Sarfati\u2019s subjects transcend their social, political, or cultural categories; as carriers of individual, as well as universal, psychological states, they represent the interstitial space between inertia and movement. \n\r\nIn Robin, #43, Oakland, CA, the young woman gazes into a backyard hidden from view. Framed by the intersecting lines of backyard fences bathed in a saturated cyan light, Robin may sit firmly on her home soil, but she is emotionally unmoored from it.",
