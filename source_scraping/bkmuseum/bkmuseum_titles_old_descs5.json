            "description": "Chapultepec, or \u201cGrasshopper Hill,\u201d was the first Mexica settlement in the Valley of Mexico, and this carved aquamarine grasshopper pendant may have a symbolic association with the site. Located on the western shore of Lake Texcoco, Chapultepec Hill was a source of fresh water for the capital city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n. It was also a sacred mountain shrine for Mexica rulers, who had their portraits carved in the rock cliffs. For the Mexica, grasshoppers signified the end of the rainy season, when crops started to grow. \n\n\r\nChapultepec, o \u201cCerro Saltamontes,\u201d fue el primer asentamiento Mexica en el Valle de M\u00e9xico, y este pendiente en forma de saltamontes de aguamarina tallada puede tener una asociaci\u00f3n simb\u00f3lica con el lugar. Ubicado en la costa oeste del Lago Texcoco, el cerro de Chapultepec era una fuente de agua fresca para la ciudad capital de Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Era tambi\u00e9n un santuario de monta\u00f1a sagrado para los gobernantes Mexica, quienes hac\u00edan tallar sus retratos en los acantilados de piedra. Para los Mexica, los saltamontes significaban el fin de la temporada lluviosa, cuando los cultivos comenzaban a crecer.",

            "description": "This painting commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad and the third imam, or leader, of the Shica Muslims. Husayn was killed by the forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I (r. 680\u2013683) in the desert of Karbala in central Iraq in 680 c.e. This battle emphasizes the divide between the Sunni and Shica branches of Islam; Husayn led a resistance against what the Shica Muslims believed was the Umayyads\u2019 illegitimate rule. The focus of this painting is Husayn\u2019s half brother, cAbbas, mounted on a white horse as he stabs a member of Yazid\u2019s army. Individual episodes related to the agonies suffered by Husayn and his companions leading up to and during the battle are illustrated in smaller-scale vignettes on the left. The hereafter is shown at the right, with Husayn and his companions in heaven above and their opponents in hell below.\n\r\n\u201cCoffeehouse\u201d Paintings \n\r\nPaintings such as The Battle of Karbala show how the monumental genre, developed for the Zand and Qajar courts (see paintings displayed nearby), was reinterpreted for popular audiences during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This account of Husayn\u2019s martyrdom inspired annual reenactments through ceremonial processions and the tacziya, the ritual theater of Iran. Narrative paintings served as portable backdrops, or pardas (curtains), that could be rolled up and transported from location to location, where a reciter (pardadar) would point to images as he recounted the story. As they were also presented in coffeehouses, such canvases are commonly referred to as qahvakhana, or \u201ccoffeehouse,\u201d paintings.",

In this iconic image, one of Bernhard\u2019s most widely recognized and a seminal work of twentieth-century photography, her masterful handling of light and form is put on display. The seemingly sleeping model is framed within a box, emphasizing the horizontal element of the composition and contrasting rectangular regularity with the flow of organic lines. Her left arm breaks away from this constraining enclosure, however, and reaches out of the box in a more comfortable stretch. The play of light and shadow enhances the contours of the body while diffusing the perception of the box, and the body seems to disappear, receding into deep shadows.",

The stool would have been used by a Lobi man of high status, with its phallic \u201cfoot\u201d protruding to convey his virility and authority. The figure, dedicated to the Yoruba cult of Shango, the orisha (god) of thunder, emphasizes female characteristics of breasts and hairdo. In addition, the bowl held by the figure has sexual and reproductive associations. \n\r\nThe two headrests are everyday objects with the same function, though their differing forms are based on the gender of the user. The blocklike form of the man\u2019s headrest contrasts with the more slender form of the woman\u2019s. Even everyday objects such as these can subtly reinforce a strict, binary concept of gender. In addition to cradling the head and protecting often elaborate coiffures during sleep, headrests also serve as emblems of status.",

He created this light fixture for Barton\u2019s Bonbonni\u00e8re, a candy store founded by a fellow Austrian Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 at Broadway and 81st Street in Manhattan in 1938. In addition to giving the store a large plate-glass fa\u00e7ade to entice customers inside, Gruen completely integrated the store\u2019s interior design and retail components, decorating the candy boxes and shopping bags with small colored dots that echoed the painted disks of the lights. A great critical success, the formula was repeated in more than fifty identical stores nationwide by 1952.\n\r\nThe ceiling lights were clearly inspired by the kinetic metal mobiles that sculptor Alexander Calder began making in Paris in the 1930s. They are an excellent example of the blurring of the boundaries between the so-called high and low arts that characterized the twentieth century.",

New technology required new forms, and as the household radio rapidly gained in popularity throughout the twenties and thirties, many designers devised different forms. Walter Dorwin Teague\u2019s radios from the mid-1930s are among the most iconic early designs. The streamlined, curving silhouettes of his radios epitomize the Art Moderne, or Art Deco, style that began about 1925. The striking blue mirrored glass seen here was a clever use of a preexisting material to enhance the radio\u2019s sense of newness.",

These experiments were put to good use during the war when Eames and his colleagues used molded plywood technology to develop a lightweight leg splint and a litter for soldiers injured in the field. Just as a chair seat needed to conform to the human body, so did a splint. The ability to mold plywood efficiently into curving shapes had important implications for postwar design.",

While she worked with him, Mestrovic did her portrait and Hoffman modeled what eventually became this over-life-size statue of her mentor. Clad in an open-collared smock and loose trousers, the figure peers intently at the lump of clay waiting to be modeled in his hand. This monumental image portrays Mestrovic, who later settled in the United States, as a heroic artist at the height of his creative powers.",

As suggested in a verse of Nugent\u2019s poem \u201cShadow\u201d (1925), the silhouette also had personal significance for the artist, who was African American: \n\r\nSilhouette \r\nA silhouette am I\nOn the face of the moon \r\nLacking color\nOr vivid brightness \r\nBut defined all the clearer\nBecause I am dark \r\nBlack on the face of the moon.",

Zuni and Cochiti potters created the three vessels here: two water jars and one drum jar, which would have had a hide stretched over the top for beating with drumsticks. Historically, women were the potters, collecting their own clays, coiling and finishing each pot by hand, and firing the pieces in open fires.\n\r\nPots were often traded and exchanged between pueblos, so that new ideas were constantly being generated. During the 1880s the advent of the railroad brought an influx of trading posts and tourists into the Southwest and entrepreneurial potters began selling to the non-Native market. Today, both male and female potters continue to form traditional works as well as generate exciting new forms of Pueblo pottery.",

Because she was generations older than the avant-garde artists she was drawn to, and being largely self-taught, Wilson acquired the nickname \u201cGrandma Moses of the Underground.\u201d In her Ridiculous Portraits, Wilson collaged ludicrous photo-booth self-portraits onto images she collected from picture postcards, reproductions of famous paintings, mainstream magazines, and soft-core pornography. Produced as personal mementos and often exchanged through the mail with other artists as gifts, her Ridiculous Portraits attacked sexism, ageism, and the cult of beauty with a wry sense of absurdity.",

The masks chosen for the ballet duet Fernandes composed for As One are known to have been danced in their own distinctive way. The female mask covered with geometric patterns in the video is from the court of the Kuba kingdom, and was originally worn as the face of a female court historian who danced in a carefully choreographed narrative. The Lele make masks that have much in common, both visually and functionally, with those of their neighbors in the central Kuba kingdom, but are much rarer.\n\r\nThe Lele sculptor of this mask employed an imaginative and skillful use of pigment to underline volume contrasts such as the convex, almond-shaped eyes\u2014accentuated by multiple eyebrows arranged one atop another\u2014and the pronounced relief of the nose, ears, and scarification marks. Such masks appear principally at the funerals of chiefs and elders but are also used in annual performances that celebrate and teach the history of Lele origins and migrations.",

The stool would have been used by a Lobi man of high status, with its phallic \u201cfoot\u201d protruding to convey his virility and authority. The figure, dedicated to the Yoruba cult of Shango, the orisha (god) of thunder, emphasizes female characteristics of breasts and hairdo. In addition, the bowl held by the figure has sexual and reproductive associations. \n\r\nThe two headrests are everyday objects with the same function, though their differing forms are based on the gender of the user. The blocklike form of the man\u2019s headrest contrasts with the more slender form of the woman\u2019s. Even everyday objects such as these can subtly reinforce a strict, binary concept of gender. In addition to cradling the head and protecting often elaborate coiffures during sleep, headrests also serve as emblems of status.",

The masked figures were believed to be incarnate spiritual beings capable of rendering unbiased judgments. The specific functions of individual masks, once removed from their village contexts, are impossible to determine. Here, the nearly closed eyes and small mouth contrast with those of other masks and probably indicate that this example served in a peacemaking function and generally created harmony in the community. On the other hand, the form of the bu gle mask (no. 2) with projecting eyes and mouth was designed to be deliberately frightening.",

A major contributor to Life magazine, starting with its inaugural edition in 1936, Bourke-White was the first of dozens of female photojournalists who appeared, and then disappeared, during the golden age of news magazines in the mid-twentieth century. Her precision and strong sense of design were formed while working as an industrial photographer, glamorizing the steel industry and urban architecture. \n\r\nIn 1930 Bourke-White was the first Western photographer allowed to take pictures in the Soviet Union. This perfectly composed, beautifully lit photograph shows infants at mealtime in a Soviet orphanage. Light plays on the almost identical heads of the sexually indeterminate three-year-olds, solemnly sharing milk and bread at a child-size table with a spotless white tablecloth.",

Born in Missouri and educated in Chicago and Paris, Benton began to seek out these themes in 1926, during the first of the many trips through the Midwest and the South. Focusing on the broad appeal of the commonplace he described American \"types\" rather than specific individuals and place, and rendered them in a directly expressive, almost caricatured manner.\n\r\nA verbal description of this work is available through Art Beyond Sight, a guide for people with visual impairments.",

They prove that the Western tradition of naturalism\u2014depicting the body precisely as observed in life\u2014is not even remotely the only possibility open to an artist. \n\r\nThe Mossi mask celebrates the female form. While it is not an exact replica of the body, the proportions are relatively balanced. \n\r\nThe Yoruba tapper, used with a board to draw images during divinations, was carved with more exaggerated proportions, owing to both the shape of the ivory from which it was carved and the functional requirements of the object. \n\r\nThe Fang figure has primarily been reduced to a series of cylinders and circles. The legs and hips are conceived as the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders, echoing the cylindrical reliquary box on which the figure sat. \n\r\nThe small Nsapo-Nsapo work and the Salampasu figure take the abstraction of the human form even further by greatly exaggerating the proportions. The Nsapo-Nsapo figure\u2019s thin, extended arms and the Salampasu sculpture\u2019s outthrust chest and flexed shoulders suggest different emotional states for these two protective figures\u2014a tense anxiety, perhaps, in one and a tense readiness in the other.",

Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea\u2019a\u2019ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).",

Wide acceptance of modern design came \r\nsomewhat later in Italy than elsewhere, perhaps because of the \r\never-present conservative influence of the palpable Roman classical past and the slow development of the Italian economy \r\nin the twentieth century. To be sure, before World War II there \r\nwere important modern designers in Italy, foremost Gio Ponti, \r\nan architect from Milan whose influence spread beyond his \r\nnative country through two architecture and design magazines he \r\nfounded, Domus and Stile. And the Fascist regime of Mussolini in \r\nthe pre-World War II period did embrace modern architecture, \r\nunlike the Nazi regime in Germany, which consciously rejected \r\nmodernism as a source of foreign, moral corruption. It was not, \r\nhowever, until the post-World War II era, when the Italian economy \r\nexpanded rapidly, that Italian modern design achieved international recognition.\r\nOne pivotal event made consumers in the United States aware \r\nof the diversity and accomplishments of modern Italian design\u2014the exhibition Italy at Work, which travelled to twelve venues \r\nbetween 1950 and 1954. The exhibition was initiated by the Art \r\nInstitute of Chicago in partnership with two organizations devoted to the promulgation of Italian design, Handicraft Development \r\nIncorporated in the United States and its corresponding institution \r\nin Italy, CADMA. Italy at Work included hundreds of objects by \r\nmore than 150 artisans and manufacturers and featured furniture, \r\nceramics, glass, textiles, metalwork, jewelry, shoes, knit clothing, \r\nand industrial design. The exhibition opened at the Brooklyn \r\nMuseum, and at its conclusion, when the objects were dispersed  \r\namong the host institutions, the lion\u2019s share, more than two hundred items,  came to the Museum.In the second half of the twentieth century, Italy became a \r\ncenter for modern design. Many foreigners went there to study \r\nand work at small, adventurous firms that produced high-quality objects.",

Combining the artist's figural interests with an affectionate family portrait, the painting offers an evocative image of subdued color and quiet charm.",

Yves Tanguy painted Surrealist landscapes devoid of human figures throughout his career.\n\nComposition and Robe du Matin\u2014created during Tanguy\u2019s self-imposed exile in the United States in the wake of World War II\u2014speak to the irrationality of war and the annihilation of Europe\u2019s people. Using Surrealist free association and unexpected juxtapositions, Tanguy frames vast voids with interlocking forms that resemble body parts and spindly rods. His dreamlike deviations from the natural world reflect Surrealism\u2019s interest in Freudian psychology and the subconscious, and perhaps the postwar landscape of 1946 Europe.",

By changing the pressure of his touch and twisting the tip of the brush, he varied the density and width of the outlines over the course of each stroke. Such variations suggest volumetric mass in an otherwise abstracted figure. After studying traditional Chinese brush drawing in Beijing in the early 1930s, Noguchi combined that technique with the reductive approach to form inspired by his mentor, the modernist sculptor Constantin Brancusi. This blending of Eastern and Western influences characterizes the art of Noguchi, who was of Japanese and American descent.",

Finely coiled baskets like the example by the Maidu weaver Mary Kea\u2019a\u2019ala Azbill were in great demand, as were Zuni Kachina dolls. The desire for Eskimo objects such as the ivory pipe engraved with a whale-hunting scene was accelerated by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. To appeal to non-Native patrons, Native artists invented new designs using trade materials such as the glass beads forming the embroidered floral arrangement on the northeastern puzzle bag (so named for the way its pieces fold together to keep it closed). Other artists used traditional materials but tailored designs to non-Native aesthetics, as seen in the porcupine-quill box. The Navajo quickly adapted to the Spanish introduction of silver coins and silver mining in the seventeenth century, embellishing their traditional wrist guards with hammered silver. Some artists retained both traditional materials and designs but produced greater quantities of popular items such as the Plains owl pipe bowl made from Catlinite (red pipestone).",
