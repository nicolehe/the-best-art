January 18, 1925 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American graphics designer and the designer of the Playboy bunny.\r\n\r\nPaul studied at the Art Institute of Chicago (1940-1943) and at the Institute of Design [Illinois Institute of Technology](1946-1950). He was working as a freelance designer when he in 1953 was contacted by playboy founder Hugh Hefner who needed a logo for his new magazine. He created the now famous rabbit wearing a tuxedo bow tie. Paul went on to design the whole first edition of the magazine and was hired by Hefner as Playboy's first art director in 1954, a position he held for 30 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1986 Paul was elected to the Hall of Fame of the Art Directors Club of New York.\r\n\r\none lithograph, offset printed",
